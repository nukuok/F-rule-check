This Standard 
is 
aim
ed 
to 
improve the interconnectivity between 
the 
IMS networks 
with
in Japan by providing 
a 
common 
interpretation 
of the interconnection conditions using the II

Contents 


This Standard 
specifies national supplementary specifications of [TS 
29.165] within the scope described in 
S
ubclause 
1.1. 


This Standard 
distinguish
es 
the specification

as is the 
case with [TS 
29.165]. 
Note that the 
term 
"II

shall be supported. 
When an originating IMS network accesses ENUM/DNS 
specified 
in [JJ
-
90.31], the 
originating 
IMS network shall set 
"npdi" tel URI parameter to 
indicate 
to 
a terminating IMS network that 
the originating IMS network 
has 
already 
accesse
d

NOTE: In the period that there are both interconnection on ISUP interface defined in [JJ-90.10] and 
interconnection on SIP interface defined in this Standard, a NAPTR resource record containing "rn" 
parameter may be returned from ENUM/DNS interface defined in [JJ-90.31]. 

When receiving 
a 
SIP request outside an existing dialog containing "npdi" parameter, 
a 
terminating IMS network 
shall 
consider 
that ENUM/DNS access has been done in the 
preceding 
IMS network, and then 
should not access 
ENUM/DNS defined in [JJ

4.2. 
Calling party number presentation and restriction 


Calling 
party number 
presentation 
and restriction 
is realized by 
means of delivering 
network 
asserted 
user 
identity 
information and presentation/re
striction information. 
If 
the network 
asserted 
user 
identity information is 
delivered 
between 
the 
IMS networks, 
then 
a 
trust relationship 
with respect to the 
P
-
Asserted
-
Identity header field 
shall exist 
between 
the two 
interconnected networks. 


The terms used in this 
subclause
, "
n
etwork 
asserted user identity information" and "
p
resentation/
r
estriction information" 
are defined as follows
: 


<
N
etwork 
asserted user identity information> 


This is i
nformation 
with respect to 
an 
identity of a user that is 
asserted by the network through authentication or other 
means (or verified by the network 
when 
an identity is 
provided by the user) 
in 
a 
trusted network
. An example of 
network 
asserted user identity information is an E.164 number reachable to the user. Note that subaddress information 
provided by 
the 
originating user 
can 
be included. 


<
P
resentation/
r
estriction information> 


This is i
nformation specifying whether a user 
is allowing 
or prohibiting the presentation of its network 
asserted user 
identity information to another user recei
v
ing a 
SIP 
message. 


(1) The calling party number is delivered in a SIP request outside an existing dialog (INVITE, MESSAGE, 
SUBSCRIBE or REFER request outside an existing dialog). 

(2) The calling party number is set in each parameter value of the P-Asserted-Identity header field. This header field 
shall be set in a SIP request outside an existing dialog in accordance with [TS 29.165]. 

(3) For elements associated with the handling of the calling party number, the parameters defined in Table 4.2.1 are 
used and the presentation conditions conform to Table 4.2.2. 


Table 4.2.1 / JJ-90.30: Elements associated with handling of calling party number 

1) 

SIP_URI 

Network asserted user identity reachable from the IMS network. 

The addr-spec part of the SIP URI in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of a SIP 
request outside an existing dialog is symbolized by the "SIP_URI". 

2) 

SIP_DISPLAYNAME 

Network asserted user identity associated with the SIP_URI, including 
information other than the number to be displayed to the terminating user. 

The display-name part of the SIP_URI in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of a 
SIP request outside an existing dialog, which is character strings in UTF-8 
encoding, is symbolized by the "SIP_DISPLAYNAME". When it is enclosed in 
quotation marks, the "SIP_DISPLAYNAME" is character strings left after 
removing the double quotation marks (DQUOTE). 

Omission of the SIP_DISPLAYNAME indicates that a display format different 
from the SIP_URI is not particularly desired. In this case, the IMS network 
should take into account that the character strings of the SIP_URI are used for 
display, unless special restrictions are specified. 

3) 

TEL_URI 

Network asserted user identity consisting of an E.164 number reachable from a 
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). 

The global-number-digits in the telephone-subscriber part of the tel URI in the P-
Asserted-Identity header field of a SIP request outside an existing dialog is 
symbolized by the "TEL_URI". 

Omission of the TEL_URI indicates that the originating user has no E.164 
number for receiving incoming calls. 

4) 

TEL_DISPLAYNAME 

Network asserted user identity consisting of a dial number by which the 
originating user can be reached based on a numbering plan. 

The display-name part of the tel URI in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of a 
SIP request outside an existing dialog is symbolized by the 
"TEL_DISPLAYNAME". When it is enclosed in quotation marks, the 
"TEL_DISPLAYNAME" is the character strings left after removing the double 
quotation marks (DQUOTE). 

Omission of the TEL_DISPLAYNAME indicates that a dial number different 
from the number indicated by the TEL_URI is not particularly desired, or that the 
network does not have accurate information pertaining to the dialling numbering 
plan that can be used by the terminating user. In this case, the IMS network 
should take into account that the character strings of the TEL_URI are equivalent 
to the TEL_DISPLAYNAME, unless special restrictions are specified. 

5) 

PRIVACY 

Presentation/restriction information identifying whether the presentation of 
network asserted user identity to the terminating user is allowed. 

The value (priv-value) of the Privacy header field of a SIP request outside an 
existing dialog is symbolized by the "PRIVACY".

Calling party number 

(Subscriber number) 

TEL_URI 

Used as a number identifying the originating user. 

Visual-separators are not used. 

Specific setting contents are listed in Table 4.2.3. 

Generic number 

(Notified number) 

TEL_DISPLAYNAME 

Used when a number other than the calling party number is 
notified to the terminating side. 

Visual-separators are not used. 

Specific setting contents are listed in Table 4.2.4. 

Presentation/restriction 

PRIVACY 

"none" and "id" are treated as displayable and not 
displayable, respectively. Values other than "none" and "id" 
shall not be set. 

Assumed to be displayable when the Privacy header field is 
absent. 

When both calling party number (subscriber number) and 
generic number (notified number) are set, this component is 
treated as the presentation/restriction for the generic number 
(notified number), and the calling number (subscriber 
number) is uniformly handled as the number being restricted 
to display. 

Cause of no ID 

SIP_DISPLAYNAME 

Character strings in UTF-8 encoding. 

When the presentation/restriction information is restriction, 
the character strings in Table 4.2.5 can be used to indicate 
the cause. 

If the "SIP_DISPLAYNAME" is not set, or if character 
strings not listed in Table 4.2.5 are set, then the call is 
handled as if "Unavailable" were specified.

Unallocated 
(unassigned) number talkie 


An unallocated (unassigned) number talkie is 
one of the 
guidance/talkie servie
s 
provided 
by 
an 
IMS network
. This 



subclause describes the functions and 
procedures required for 
an 
IMS network when providing a
n 
unallocated 
(unassigned) number talkie service. 


4.3.1. 
P
rovi
sion of 
unallocated (unassigned) number talkie service 


In principle, t
he following conditions 
shall 
be followed 
when connecting to an unallocated (unassigned) number talkie
: 


- A terminating IMS network returns a SIP response indicating an unallocated number to an originating IMS 
network, and a connection to the unallocated (unassigned) number talkie is established inside the originating 
IMS network. 

- When a terminating IMS network is unable to guarantee the notification of an unallocated (unassigned) number, 
the terminating IMS network notifies the original IMS network of a status other than "unallocated (unassigned) 
number" in order to avoid a talkie connection inside the originating IMS network. 

If 
a 
SIP 
response indicating 
an 
unallocated number is 
delivered 
between IMS networks, 
then 
a 
trust relationship 
with 
respect to the 
Reason header field 
shall exist 
between 
the two 
interconnected networks in accordance with 
S
ubclause 
6.1
.1.3.1 of [
T
S 
29.165]. 


4.3.1.1
. 
Required f
unctionality 
on 
terminating 
IMS network 
side 


When the 
received 
called party 
number is an unallocated number, the terminating IMS network sends back a 404 (Not 
Found) response contain
ing 
a Reason header field. When 
receiving 
a 404 
(Not Found) 
response containing a Reason 
header field from 
terminating user equipment
, the termina
t
ing IMS network shall 
verify 
whether the 
SIP 
response can 
be 
guaranteed 
then 
returns the 
SIP 
response only when the 
called party 
number is 
ac
tually 
an unallocated number (i.e. 
the 
SIP 
response can be guaranteed). 


When an unallocated number is detected, the Reason header field 
is encoded 
as 
follows
. 


Reason: Q.850;cause=1;text="unallocated number" 


(The setting of text="unallocated number" 
can be 
omitted.
) 


4.3.1.2. 
Required f
unctionality 
on 
originating 
IMS network 
side 


When 
receiving 
a 404

response contain

a Reason header field
, 
specified in 
S
ubclause 
4.3.1.1
, 
from 
the 
terminating IMS network, 
the originating network 
takes into accou
nt 
that 
the called 
party 
number is 
an 
unallocated 
number 
then 
connects to 
an 
unalloc
ated (unassigned) number talkie
.

General 


The 
services equivalent to 
those 
provided 
by the transfer of subaddress information 
available 
in the ISUP network 
through the interconnection interface defined in [JJ
-
90.10] 
may be provided for served users in the IMS network
. 
Application of subaddress information at the II
-
NNI is determined in the inter
-
operator agreements in accordance with 
S
ubclause 
8.1 of [
T
S 
29.165]. 
{Appendix 
T

This 
a
nnex 
specifies 
th
e 
signalling 
requirements of subaddress information in SIP messages as a complementa
r
y of [TS
-
1008] to 
properly 
deliver 
subaddress information at the II
-
NNI. 
If 
subaddress information 
is 
delivered at the II
-
NNI 
between 
the 
IMS networks
, 
the signalling requirements in 
this 
a
nnex 
shall be followed
. 
Except 
for 
th
e 
signalling 
requirements 
described in this annex
, t
he IMS networks 
shall 
follow the 
signalling requirements 
for 
NNI 
defined 
in 
[TS

. 


b.2. 
Content of subaddress information 


The 
content of subaddress information is 19 
decimal 
digits or less 
strings 
using numbers 0 to 9. The 
other 
details 
are 
based on 
[RFC 
4715
] 
and [TS
-
1008]
. 


b.3. 
Formats of subaddress information 


Subaddress information 
can be 
populated 
in
to the 
SIP header fields representing the 
originating party (From 
header 
field and 
P
-
Asserted
-
Identity 
header field
), the 
SIP 
header 
fields 
representing 
the terminating party (To 
header field
)
, 
and Request
-
URI 
set to the SIP URI 
of 
any SIP requests and responses
. 
Subaddress is 
represented 
as a tel URI 
parameter (
which 
is described after the semicolon (;) 
appended after 
global

digits) 
and the subaddress 
information is populated as 
decimal 
digits strings appended after 
"isub=". 



Annex c 
(Normative)
: 
SDP non
-
t
ransparency 
with
in early dialog 


c.1. 
General 


This annex defines SDP non
-
transparency 
with
in early dialog. This annex may not be applied depending on the results 
of 
option item selection 
(e.g., use of precondition). 


c.2. 
Guidance/talkie services 


Guidance/talkie services may be provided by 
either 
the originating IMS network or the terminating IMS network. 


c.2.1. 
Guidance/talkie services 
provided by 
terminating IMS network 


It is conceivable that guidance/talkie services might be provided from the te
rminating IMS network 
within 
either 
an 
early dialog or 
a 
confirmed dialog. 


Guidance/talkie services provided from the terminating IMS network 
within 
an early dialog are realized by adding SDP 
information 
in
to a 18x 
provisional 
response. From the view point 
of preventin
g 
illegally non
-
charged calls 
on 
an 
early 
dialog, the terminating IMS network can return 
a 
18x 
provisional 
response with SDP information only when the 
terminating IMS network can manage and guarantee the contents of audio RTP. The terminating 
IMS network shall not 
forward 
a 
18x 
provisional 
response transparently if 
the 
18x 
provisional 
response contain
s 
SDP information 
inserted 
by 
t
erminating user equipment
. 


G
uidance/talkie services provided 
with
in a confirmed dialog from the terminating IMS 
network are handled as normally 
connected calls (successful calls) at the originating IMS network. 


c.2.2. 
Guidance/talkie services 
provided by o
riginating IMS network 


For 
provid
ing 
guidance/talkie services, 
an 
originating IMS network 
can 
use status codes o
f 
SIP 
responses returned from 
a 
terminating IMS network. 
When sending a SIP response containing a status codes used for a guidance/talkie service, 
the terminating IMS network shall guarantee the contents of the SIP 
response 
in order to 
prevent unexpected 
c
onnections to guidance/talkie services
. 
The status codes used for guidance/talkie services are determined 
in 
the inter
-
operator agreement
s
. {Appendix

c.3. 
Connections 
to 
network
-
originated RTP 
audio 
during 
call establishment 


In 
a 
PSTN, 
a 
terminating network 
and 
a transit network 
can connect to an 
announcement 
service for an unsuccessful 
call 
in order to provide the originating user with a voice message to notify why the call was unsuccessful. 
The 
v
oice 
path from the terminating 
side 
to the originating 
side 
is normally connected before call establishment 
in a PSTN
; 
th
erefore, 
the audio inserted by the network can be heard by the originating user 
even 
before the call is completed
. 


In the 
circumstances 
in which 
a terminating user equipm
ent is not 
completely
-
controlled by the network
, 
the 
equipment 
can 
send out RTP audio over the II
-
NNI. 
For preventing illegal use of the network, an 
originating IMS network or 
a 
transit IMS network 
may 
prohibit

originated RTP audio connections in the above 
model are 
described below. Note that these are logical classes whose roles may change depending on the call being 
originated
. 
Also note that an IMS network 
is 
capable of undertaking multiple roles simultaneously, the roles themselves may be 
omitted if not 
required, in calls that are actually 
established
. 


<IMS network connecting to network
-

This is a
n IMS network that connects to a network
-
managed RTP audio source before call establishment with regard to 
an initial INVITE request received via 
an II
-
NNI. The IMS network is responsible for the content of the audio source 
connected before call establishment. 


This network corresponds to an IMS network that actually prepares network
-
originated announcements
, 
such as 
congestion talkies
, 
then 
perform
s connections according to conditions. 


<IMS network relaying provisional responses> 


This is a
n IMS network that transmits a corresponding initial INVITE request received from the originating IMS 
network via an II

NN
I. 


<IMS network 
managing

This is a
n IMS network that manages path connections to prevent the connection of the audio path 
from the terminating 
side to the originating side before call establishment 
corresponding 
to the call 
being 
established by the initial INVITE 
request sent via an II
-
NNI. An IMS network manag
ing 
the 
path connections before call establishment 
shall 
manage 
the 
equipment that terminate
s 
RTP voice traffic from the terminating 
IMS 
network. Equipment 
that can be used to manage 
these path connections includes 
MG
W 
that connect
s 
with PSTN, and 
SBC 
that terminate
s 
RTP packets in a network.

with regard 
to

Procedures 
at the 
originating IMS network for 
network
-
originated RTP audio 
during call 
establishment 


The following supplementary specification is applied to the 180 (Ringing) and 183 (Session Progress) 
responses: 



- An IMS network that sends a SIP response may send SDP information only when the IMS network can manage 
and guarantee the contents of the RTP audio sent out to another IMS network that receives the SIP response. 

Accordingly, when an IMS network 
that has received an initial INVITE request via an II
-
NNI connects a network
-
originated RTP audio before call establishment, 
the IMS network shall insert 
an SDP in
to 
either 
a 
180 (Ringing) or 183 
(Session Progress) response 
for RTP connection 
only when th
e 
IMS network can manage and guarantee the 
contents of 
the 
RTP 
audio sent out to 
another 
IMS network 
that 
receives the 
SIP 
response. 


Also, when there is a possibility of receiving an SDP from an entity that is unable to guarantee the contents of a 
connected RTP due to the circumstances of the network configuration or 
user equipment 
management
1, one of the 
following 
procedure
s 
shall be p
erformed against 
the SIP 
message received from such an entity
2. 


1 
This condition includes cases 
in which 
it is possible for a subscriber who is performing unexpected actions (possibly 
with malicious intent) to send outside the framework normally envisaged by the IMS network. 


2 
When it is guaranteed that there is no IMS network managing path connections befor
e call establishment on the 
originating IMS network side (i.e. the receiving side of the SIP response), there is no specific problem as the illegal use 
of network even if the countermeasures mentioned here are not taken. However, countermeasures should be 
taken from 
the viewpoint of ensuring normality and expandability of connections on the II
-
NNI. 


3 
In this case, it may be 
necessary 
for the IMS network to have a function that terminates an RTP such as an SBC. 


1. Delete the SDP and send the corresponding SIP response. 

2. Send the SIP response including received SDP, but prevent delivering the RTP from the terminating side to the 
originating side. 

Wh
en adopting 
P
rocedure 
1, an SDP may not be included in 
the 
200 (OK) response that might subsequently be sent 
in 
which the 
"100rel" extension is applied
. Therefore, 
if an IMS network delete
s 
the contents of the SDP from the 
provisional response
, then 
the 
IMS network shall store the received SDP before deleting the SDP
. 
I
f 
there is no SDP 
included in the 200 (OK) response, 
then 
the IMS network 
shall insert the stored SDP into the 200 (OK) response as if 
the SDP is received in the 200 (OK) response. 


When ado
pting 
P
rocedure 
2, it 
shall 
be ensured that the terminating side is not made aware of the address and port 
information included in the SDP 
of 
the received initial INVITE request

. 


This annex 
specifies 
the 
use 
of 
the 
calling party's category information between IMS networks. 
If 
the 
calling party's 
category 
information 
is delivered between IMS networks, 
then 
a tr
us
t relationship with respect to 
the 
"cpc" tel URI 
parameter 
shall exist between the two interconnected netwo
rks in accordance with 
S
ubclause 
6.1.1.3.1 of [TS 
29.165]. 


d.2. 
Clarification 
on 
use 
of "cpc" tel URI parameter 


The c
alling party's category information is exchanged between 
the 
IMS networks by 
populating 
the 
"cpc" 
tel URI 
parameter 
in
to the URI 
of the 
P
-
A
sserted
-
Identity header field. 


I
f the URI of the P
-
Asserted
-
Identity 
header field 
is 
a 
tel URI 
scheme
, 
then 
a "cpc" 
tel URI parameter can be populated 
into the 
par part. 
Likewise, if the URI of the P
-
Asserted
-
Identity header field is 
a 
SIP URI scheme, then 
a "cpc" 
parameter 
can be populated 
after (;) appended after global
-
number
-
digits as a tel URI parameter. 
If more than one URI 
is 
populated in
to 
the P
-
Asserted
-
Identity header field, then the same "cpc" tel URI parameter is populated into all the 
URIs. 
The 
format of 
a 
"cpc" 
tel URI 
parameter is 
given 
below in ABNF syntax that conforms to [RFC 
3966]. 


par =/ cpc 

cpc = cpc-tag "=" cpc-value 

cpc-tag = "cpc" 

cpc-value = "operator" / "ordinary" / "priority" / "test" / "payphone" / genvalue 

genvalue = 1*(alphanum / "-" / ".")

History of number translation 


f
.1. 
General 


When 
a 
service 
in which 
a 
logical 
number 
is used as a called party number 
(
e.g. the number for toll free service
s 
beginning with 
"
0120
" 
or 
"
0800
"
, 
the number fo
r 
unified service beginning with 
"
0570
"
) 
is invoked
, 
the 
logical 
number 
is translated into an actual number 
used for 
rout
ing 
of 
a 
call 
to 
the 
terminating user equipment 
(e.
g. 
the number "0AB
-
J", 
the number beginning with 
"
0A
0"
)
. 


In 
a 
network 
serving the terminating user equipment, the supplementary services (e.g. notification of an original called 
logical 
number to 
the 
terminating user equipment, call rejection when 
an original called number is an actual number 
mapped from a service number
) 
can be 
provided. Therefore, the history information of number translation from a 
logical 
number to an actual number needs to be 
del
ivered 
through 
the II
-
NNI
. 


This 
annex 
provides 
the procedures for delivering 
the 
history information of number translation over the II
-
NNI
. 
Application of delivering 
the 
history information of number translation at the II
-
NNI is determined in the inter
-
ope
rator 
agreements in accordance with 
C
lause

History information of number translation 


The h
istory information of number translation may be included up to a maximum of 
double number 
translation in the 
History
-
Info header field in 
accordance with 
[RFC 
7044
] 
and [RFC 
7131
]
. 


This annex does not specify the History
-
Info header field
; 
however, only the History
-
Info header field in the initial 
INVITE request is used 
for 
the history informa
tion of number translation. 


f.2.
1. 
Trust relationship 


If 
the 
history information of number translation is delivered between 
the 
IMS networks, 
then 
a trust relationship with 
respect to the History
-
Info header field shall exist between the two interconnected 
networks in accordance with 
S
ubclause 
6.1.1.3.1 of [
T
S 
29.165]. When an IMS network receives the History
-
Info header field in 
the 
SIP message, 
the IMS network 
shall not forward 
the 
received 
header field to user equipment via UNI. 


f.2.1A. 
Request
-
URI 


In 
order to ensure the equivalency between the Request
-
URI and the last entry of the History
-
Info header field, the 
"cause" URI parameter defined in Subclause 
f.2.2.1A shall be populated into the Request
-
URI if the "cause" URI 
parameter is present in the last 
entry of the History
-
Info header field. 
However, 
an IMS network receiving the history 
information of number translation should continue the call processing even if the Request
-
URI not contain 
the 
"cause" 
URI parameter. 


f.2.2. 
Format of SIP header field 


In 
the History
-
Info header field, 
two or more hi
-
entr
ies 
defined in 
[RFC 
7044
] 
are included. For the purposes of this 
annex, the hi
-
entry is called "entry". 


When a 
single 
number translation 
is 
performed
, the History
-
Info header field 
will contain 


1) the first entry including the called party number before performing number translation and 

2) the second entry including the called party number after performing number translation. 

In 
this annex, the entries mentioned in 1) and 2) are called "mapped
-
from
-
entr
y
" 
and "mapped
-
to
-
entry
"
, 
respectively. 


When double number translation is performed, the History
-
Info header field will contain 
three 
entries since the 
"
mapped
-
to
-
entry
" 
at the first number translation is equivalent to the 
"
mapped
-
from

entry
" 
at the second 
number 
translation.

; 
however, only 
the 
SIP URI scheme shall be used for the URI
, 
and the "npdi" and "rn" 
tel URI 
parameter
s 
shall not be included. 
In the last entry of the History
-
Info header field, 
the hos
tport 
part of the SIP 
URI shall 
be 
the domain name identifying 
the network to which the SIP request 
is 
s
ent. I
n the entries other than the last 
entry, the hostport part of the SIP URI should be the domain name or hostname (
including IP address
) identifying the 
n
etwork from which the SIP request was sent. 


f.2.2.1A.

A 
"
cause

] 
shall be 
populated into the hi

The 
value of 
"

The terminating IMS network recognizes the entry whose value of 
"
cause
" 
parameter is "380" as 
"mapped
-
to
-
entry". 


NOTE Note that there is a possibility that the value "380" indicating service number translation changes to 
another value depending on the future discussion in IETF when the IETF draft [draft-mohali-dispatch-

" 
is equivalent to 
that specified in [JJ

90.27]. 
In the first number translation, "1" and "1.1" are populated 
as 
the 
index values of the "mapped

" 
and 
the "mapped

The "mp" header field parameter 
shall be 
populated into "mapped

-
val 
defined in [RFC 7044] o
f "mp" header field parameter 
shall be 
set to the index value of "mapped

terminating IMS network 
shall 
consider a received entry as "mapped

" 
to 
indicate whether the 
presentation of 
the 
history information of number translation to the user equipment via UNI is 
allowed 
("presentation allowed") 
or restricted 
("presentation restricted")
. 
When 
specifying 
"presentation restricted", 
"Privacy=history" in escaped format is pop
ulated into the hi

uri, 
the hi

uri 
is handled 
as "presentation

". 
If 
"presentation 
allowed
" is specified, then the received network may send the information of the corresponding entry 
in 
the 
header field or parameter 
other than 
the 
History
-
Info header field 
to the user equipment via UNI. 
If "presentation 
restricted" is specified, then the recei
ved network shall not send the information of the corresponding entry to the user 
equipment via UNI.

information of number translation. The last entry due to the service using 
the 
history information of number translation 
(i.e. the last "mapped

) 
shall be equivalent to the first

f.3.1.2. 
Index value 


The setting of the index value(s) in the entry(ies) due to the service using 
the 
history information of number translation 
shall conform to this annex and from the entry containing the first di
verted
-
to number (which will appear after the last

the setting of index value(s) shall conform 
to the rule of communication diversion.

the 
"called IN number" 
defined in

3.73 
and 
the 
"original called IN number"

If there is a 
single 
"mapped

entry
"
, 
then the entry 
corresponds 
to 
the called IN number. If there are two "mapped
-
from
-
entries
"
, then the first "mapped
-
from" entry and the second "mapped
-
from" entry correspond to the original called 
IN number and the called IN number
, 
respectively.

Introduction 


For improving the inter
-
connectivity between IMS networks within Japan, t
his appendix 
provides 
the 
list of option 
item
s 
that are recommended to be selected by inter
-
operator agreements 
in 
this Standa
rd
. 


If 
there 
remains 
item(s) 
that 
should be determined 
for an option item by the inter
-
operator agreements in "Details for 
operator choice" 
in 
A
nnex 
a of 
this Standard
, 
then 
the 
option 
item 
is 
also 
listed here, even if "Applicability at the II
-
NNI" of the option item is 
already 
selected
. 


Note that 
any interaction among the option items 
is 
not descri
b
ed in the list of option items
, 
as 
with 
[TS 
29.165]. Note 
also that if there are 
misalignment
s 
between 
[TS 
29.165] 
and this a
ppendix
, 
or misalignments between 
the normative 
part of 
this Standard 
and this appendix, [TS

Hatching "Yes" 

This type of item shows that there are the details that are 
recommended to be selected in "Details for operator choice" although 
"Yes" is selected in the main body and/or Appendix of this Standard. 

No hatching 

This type of item is option item. 

 

In case "Yes" is 
selected in the 
inter-operator 
agreements. 

This means the capability(ies) and/or 
service(s) relating to the option item are 
provided over the II-NNI. 

In this case, each side IMS operator's 
network of II-NNI support the 
capability(ies) in accordance with this 
Standard and normative reference(s). 

In case "No" is 
selected in the 
inter-operator 
agreements. 

This means the capability(ies) and/or 
service(s) relating to the option item are not 
provided over the II-NNI. 

In this case, each side IMS operator's 
network of II-NNI will not gurantee the 
provision of the capability(ies) in 
accordance with this Standard and 
normative reference(s).

(
defined 
in [JT

In 
the 
redirection 
mechanism used 
between PSTNs, 
the 
IAM 
redirected 
and redirection REL are used to transfer the 
following address information
: 


- Network routing number 

- Called directory number 

NOTE: The network routing number can be included in the address signal of the called party number parameter in 
the IAM or included in the address signal of the redirection number parameter in the REL. 

NOTE: Called directory number is included in the address signal of the called directory number parameter. 

When 
a MGCF 
receives a
n 
IAM 
that was redirected
, 
the 
global
-
number
-
digits of 
the 
Request
-
URI in 
the 
initial INVITE 
request is derived from 
the 
called 
directory number
. 
T
hen the 
"npdi" tel URI parameter and 
the 
"rn" parameter 
containing the 
network routing number 
that starts from "81" are 
populated
. 


When 
a MGCF 
receives a 
REL 
that 
triggers the redirection
, 
the 
global
-
number
-
digits of 
the 
SIP URI in the C
ontact 
header field of 3xx response 
is derived from 
the

Control
ling 
number of simultaneous SIP sessions 


iii.1.1. 
General 


This clause describes the mechanism to control the number of simultaneous SIP sessions 
between interconnected 
operator
'
s 
network
s
. 


iii.1.2. 
Basic principle 


If 
the maximum number of simultaneous SIP sess
ions is determined in the inter
-
operator agreements, 
then 
the operator
s 
can 
restrict 
the number of outgoing simultaneous SIP sessions (called unidirectional session management) 
when some 
kind of event 
(
e.g.
, 
network congestion
) 
occur
s 
in order 
to prevent 
the network resource
s for 
the 
control plane 
from 
being 
occupied by 
unidirectional 
session establish
ment attempts 
from 
one side of 
the 
interconnected 
network. 
{Appe
ndix 
T
able

tem

T
he number of simultaneous 
SIP sessions 
is 
incremented 
when 
a 
SIP 
r
equest 
outside an existing dialog 
(e.g., initial 
INVITE request) is sent 
out
, and 
decremented 
when 
a 
SIP session 
is terminated. 


When the number of simultaneous SIP session
s 
is control
l
ed by conditions other than 
the 
maximum number of SIP 
sessions, the deta
iled condition is determined 
in the inter
-
operator agreements
. 


iii.1.3. 
Control
ling 
number of outgoing SIP sessions by unidirectional session management 


The m
aximum number of outgoing SIP sessions 
at each side of 
an 
operator
'
s 
network 
is determined in the inter
-
operator 
agreements. The sum of both 
side of 
the 
operator's 
maximum numbers of outgoing SIP sessions 
is 
equal to the 
maximum number of SIP sessions. 


If the control 
o
f 
the 
reserved 
number of 
SIP sessions for 
calling subscriber
s 
wi
th priority is 
required 
in addition to the 
control of the number of outgoing SIP sessions, each IMS network configures the number of reserved SIP sessions 
based on 
the 
operator policy and applies the control of 
the 
reserved SIP sessions. 
In this case, t
he 
number of 
the 
reserved SIP sessions is included in the maximum number of outgoing SIP sessions. 


iii.2. 
Connection test 


iii.2.1. 
General 


This clause describes test systems for connectivity 
check 
between 
the 
interconnected 
operator
'
s 
network
s
. 


1) The purpose of the test system includes preventive maintenance, failure search in the event of fault occurrence, 
restoration confirmation, and functional checks when installing new equipment. 

2) The following test is possible between the interconnected operator's networks: 

- Normality test for IP routing and normality test for signalling (SIP) / bearer (RTP) as a normality test 

- Normality test for routing configuration of SIP messages as a connection test 

3) In principle, each operator is responsible for testing its own equipment, and an operator can not perform tests on 
another operator's equipment. 

iii.2.2. 
Types of tests 


1) Normality test 

 Each operator performs the normality tests per POI. 

a) Normality test for IP routing 

 The function of checking the normality of IP routing using "ping" program is provided. 

b) Normality test for SIP signalling / RTP bearer 


 The function of checking the normality by confirming that the media bearer is connected to the media 
resource corresponding to telephone numbers for the tests, is provided. 

(2) Connection test 

 The function of checking the normality of routing configurations corresponding to telephone numbers for tests 
assigned to each telephone number range (e.g., area code). The normality of routing configurations with respect 
to a telephone number for the test is confirmed by the audio media from the media resource or sending out of a 
180 (Ringing) response or a 487 (Request Terminated) response from the terminating network. 

iii.2.3. 
Numberi
ng config
uration 
for connection tests 


This subclause describes the numbering configuration 
for connection tests. 
Regarding t
he contents related to 
telephone 
number information in the SIP message
, 
the 
requirements 
are 
specified in the 
main body of 
this Standard
. 


1) Testing by PSTN and IP telephone (Category A) number 

 Testing with an operator having IP telephone (Category A) numbers is performed, in principle, with the 
following number format. 

 area code + local exchange number + XXXX 

 area code: Typical area code used by operator. 

 XXXX: Subscriber number allocated for normality and connection tests (e.g., 0060, 2599). 

2) Testing by mobile phone, PHS, and pager service identification numbers 

 Testing with an operator having mobile phone, PHS, and pager service identification numbers is performed, in 
principle, with the following number format. 

 A0 + CDE + 12X 

 A: 2 (pager), 7 (PHS), 7 to 9 (mobile phone). 

 CDE: Operator identification code (one required for each operator; C excludes 0). 

3) Testing by IP telephone (Category B) service identification numbers 

 Testing with an operator having IP telephone (Category B) service identification numbers is performed, in 
principle, with the following number format. 

 50 + CDEF + XXXX 

 CDEF: Operator identification code (one required for each operator; C excludes 0). 

 XXXX: Subscriber number for the tests between the operator's different networks. The numbers are allocated 
for each connection. 

iii.2.4. 
Indication of test call 


When 
the 
calling party's category is applied to ind
icate that the call is "test call", 
a 
"cpc
" 
tel URI 
parameter 
with the 
value "test" in 
the P
-
Asserted
-
Identity header field 
of 
the initial INVITE request 
is used based on the signalling 
requirement 
specified in 
A
nnex 
d. 


iii.2.5. 
Call flows of tests 
for interconnection 
between operator
'
s 
network 


1) Normality test 

 The call flows for normality tests of signalling (SIP) / bearer (RTP) are equivalent to those provided in 
Subclause vi.2.1 and Subclause vi.2.2. 

2) Connection test 

 The call flow for connection test is equivalent to that provided in Subclause vi.2.3. 


iii.3. 
Maintenance blocking system 


iii.3.1. 
General 


This clause describes the required functions for enforcement of maintenance blocking between 
interconnected 
operator
'
s 
network
s
. 


iii.3.2. 
Required functions 


Pre
-
blocking function and blocking function required for maintenance blocking are defined as follows. 


(1) Pre-blocking function 

 The pre-blocking function restricts the sending out of a SIP request outside an existing dialog from its own 
network to the opposite network based on the IP addresses belonging to the opposite network. Established 
sessions are not restricted. The operator responsible for maintenance can confirm or be notified that all sessions 
are terminated. 

(2) Blocking function 

 The blocking function restricts the sending out of a SIP request outside an existing dialog from its own network 
to the opposite network, but does not restrict the receiving of a SIP request outside an existing dialog from the 
opposite network to its own network. 

 When implementing a function that sends a test call in the network, the network can send a test call to the 
opposite network, even if blocking is being enforced in the network.

4/IPv6 fallback connection. 


When a SIP session is initiated from an originating IMS network to a terminating IMS network using 
the 
IPv6 address, 
the 488 (Not Acceptable Here) 
response containing the Warning header field set t
o either warn
-
code "300" indicating 
"Incompatible network protocol" or

-
code 
indicating "
incompatible network address format" 
should be sent 
back to the originating IMS network if the IPv6 communication is not available for the terminating IMS netw
ork or the 
terminating user equipment. 


When receiving the 488 response containing the Warning header field set to either warn
-
code "300" or warn
-
code "301", 
the originating IMS network or the originating user equipment can consider that 
the IPv6 communicat
ion is not 
available for the terminating IMS network or the terminating user equipment, 
then 
can 
initiate a new SIP session 
using 
the 
IPv
4 
address
. 


 



Appendix v 
(Informative)
: 
TCP usage for control plane 


v.1. 
Introduction 


[RFC 
3261] 
specifies that a SIP 
message shall be tra
n
sported using TCP transport when sending a SIP message whose 
total length exceeds 
the 
length 
that 
may cause fragmentation 
on 
UDP transport
. 


This appendix describes the transport mechanism when TCP transport is used over the II
-
NNI, as 
an example usage of 
TCP transport. In particular, this appendix provides the details not clarified in [RFC 
3261]
. 


v.2. 
TCP transport mechanism 


According to the specification of [RFC 
3261]
, 
the principle of usage are: 


- A SIP request is sent on the TCP connection established from the node sending the SIP request. 

- A SIP response to the SIP request is sent on the TCP connection on which the SIP request was received. 

Therefore, two TCP connections, a TCP connection estab
l
ished by one side of the II
-
NNI an
d a TCP connection 
established by the other side of the II
-
NNI, are normally established between 
the 
two nodes for sending and receiving 
SIP message over the II
-
NNI. 


There is a concern about the performance impact on the IMS network where massive calls are 
handled due to per
-
call 
basis establishment and release of TCP connection specified in [RFC 
3261]. Therefore, the existing TCP connections 
over the II
-
NNI can be retained for a long period and be used for the transportation of multiple SIP messages. 


When 
the TCP connection established by its own node is temporarily unable to 
be 
use
d 
for sendi
n
g 
SIP 
requests while 
two TCP connections are retain
ed 
for a long period, another TCP connection established by the node on the 
opposite 
side of the II
-
NNI can be used 
for sending SIP request
s 
outside an existing dialog, based on the inter
-
operator 
agreements. {Appendix 
T
able 
i.4.9 
I
tem 
3} 


Other conditions on the usage of TCP transport (e.g. port number, timer condition, maximum SIP message length) are 
de
termined 
based 
on the inter
-
operator agreements. {Appendix 
T
able 
i.4.9 
I
tem 
3} 


v.3. 
Long
-
period TCP connection establishment and release trigger 


If the long
-
period TCP connections are used over the II
-
NNI, the TCP connections can be established prior to sending 
and recei
ving SIP messages over the II
-
NNI. In this case, the procedure of TCP connection establishment and release, 
and the number of simultaneous TCP connections are de
termined 
based on the inter
-
operator agreements. 
{Appendix 
T
able 
i.4.9 
I
tem 
1} 


For the purpose 
of 
alive 
monitoring
, the keepalive mechanism is recommended to apply for existing long
-
term TCP 
connections over the II
-
NNI. If keepalive 
mechanism 
is used, 
the 
timeout value is assumed to be small enough 
com
p
ared to SIP Timer B, and the basic procedure 
consists 
of sending probe packets from both sides. Parameters of 
the 
keepalive procedure are de
termined 
based on the inter
-
operator agreements. {Appendix
