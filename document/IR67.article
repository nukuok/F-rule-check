1 Introduction 

1.1 Overview 

Inter Service Provider IP communications are starting to evolve to support services other 
than GPRS Roaming. Many, if not all, of these services rely upon DNS. Therefore, it is of 
utmost importance for the interworking and stability of such services that Service Providers 
have all the necessary information to hand to ease configuration of their DNS servers upon 
which such services rely. 

This document is intended to provide guidelines and technical information for those who 
need to set up and/or maintain DNS servers for inter Service Provider services. This 
document is not intended to provide a general education on DNS or ENUM. Thus, a 
reasonable level of technical competence in DNS, ENUM and DNS/ENUM server 
configuration is assumed throughout this document. 

1.2 Scope 

This GSMA official document provides recommendations on DNS (including ENUM) to 
facilitate successful interworking of inter-Service Provider services. In particular, guidelines 
for general and service specific configuration of DNS/ENUM servers, GSMA processes and 
procedures relating to formats and usage of domain names and sub-domain names, 
updates to the GRX/IPX Root DNS Server and guidelines and recommendations on GSMA 
Carrier ENUM. 

Particular attention is given to DNS/ENUM servers connected to the private, inter-Service 
Provider backbone network known as the "GRX" or "IPX", as described in GSMA PRD 
IR.34 [12]. 

Out of the scope of this document are vendor specific implementation/architecture options 
and configuration of DNS/ENUM servers used on the Internet (e.g. those DNS servers 
attached to the Internet for web site hosting). The only exception to this is the guidelines for 
sub domains used for any standardised services that specifically use the Internet i.e. those 
that use the "pub.3gppnetwork.org" domain name.

Delegation 

When a part of a zone is maintained separately, it is delegated to a new 
nameserver that will have authority of that part of the domain namespace. The 
original zone will have the nameserver (NS) record for the delegated domain and 
the new sub-zone will have a new Start Of Authority (SOA) record. 

DNS Client 

See "DNS Resolver". 

Domain 
Name 

A Domain Name consists of two or more labels separated with a dot (Åe.Åf) character. 
It starts from the least significant domain on the left, and ends with the most 
significant domain (or top-level domain) on the right. This naming convention 
naturally defines a hierarchy. 

DNS 
Resolver 

Also known as a "DNS Client", this is an entity that is attempting to resolve a given 
domain name to an address or vice versa. Usually the DNS Resolver is connected 
to a local DNS caching server that performs the DNS look-ups on behalf of the DNS 
Resolver. Application programs use function calls, such as ÅegethostbynameÅf, to find 
the IP address representing a domain name. The name may be specified either as 
a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or only partially. In the latter case, the DNS 
Resolver appends (a) configured local domain name(s) at the end of the name. 




Term 

Description 

DNS Server 

A DNS Server can be a Nameserver, a Local Caching DNS Server or both. It is 
common that all DNS Servers cache results from queries for a specific amount of 
time. 

GRX/IPX 

GPRS roaming eXchange/IP Packet eXchange. The GRX/IPX is an inter-operator 
IP backbone network that is transparent to subscribers. It is used for back-end 
routing/tunnelling purposes only. 

Nameserver 

Takes care of DNS Queries sent by DNS Resolvers. The query is answered by 
using locally stored information (either configured locally or cached from a previous 
query result), by requesting the information from another DNS Server, or by 
providing the DNS Resolver with the details of another DNS Server to query. One 
Nameserver can serve (i.e. be authoritative for) several domains. There may also 
be several Nameservers serving one domain (usually one is the Primary, and the 
other/rest are Secondaries). 

Zone 

DNS is a distributed database that contains information of each domain name. Each 
DNS server maintains a part of the database called a zone. Usually a zone contains 
information of one domain. However, one zone may contain information about many 
(sub) domains. Each information element is stored in a record that contains at least 
a domain name and type (which includes type specific information).

2 DNS As Used on the GRX/IPX 

2.1 Introduction 

The Domain Name System is critical to such services as GPRS roaming, inter-PLMN MMS 
delivery and IMS inter-working. DNS is defined in many IETF RFC documents; the most 
notable ones are IETF RFC 1034 [1] and IETF RFC 1035 [2]. 

2.2 Architecture 

The DNS on the inter-PLMN IP backbone network (known as the "GRX/IPX") is completely 
separate from the DNS on the Internet. This is purposely done to add an extra layer of 
security to the GRX/IPX network, and the nodes within it. The GRX/IPX Root DNS Servers 
that network operators see are known as "Slave" Root DNS Servers and are commonly 
provisioned by that Service Provider's GRX/IPX Service Provider. However, these Slave 
Root DNS Servers can be provisioned by operators themselves if they so wish. 

Each Slave Root DNS Server is synchronised with a "Master" Root DNS Server. This 
process of synchronisation is known as a "Zone Transfer" and ensures that the data is the 
same in all GRX/IPX Service Providers' and Operators' Slave Root DNS Servers. The 
following diagram depicts this:

Figure 1: Backbone Architecture 


The data in the Master Root DNS Server is known as the Master Zone File. The population 
of the data that goes into the Master Zone File has a number of sources, mainly Operators, 
GRX/IPX Providers and GRX/IPX Providers acting on behalf of Operators. It is also policed 
and validated by the Master Root DNS Server providers (under authority from GSMA) to 


ensure such things as correct sub-domain allocation and usage etc. The following diagram 
depicts this:

hostnames to IP addresses or vice versa. The numbered steps below in the diagram

1. The Resolver (for example an SGSN trying to find out the IP address of a GGSN) 
sends a query for the hostname (for example an APN) for which it wants the IP 
address, to its local caching DNS server. 
2. The local caching DNS server checks to see if it has the answer to the query in its 
cache. If it does it answers immediately (with message 6). Otherwise, it forwards the 
query on to the Root DNS server. The Root DNS server may reside in Service 
Provider 1's network or it may reside in the GRX/IPX provider's network (GRX1). The 
address(es) of the Root DNS server may either be statically configured or be found 
by using Host Anycasting (see below). 
3. The Root DNS server returns a referral to the DNS server which is authoritative for 
the queried domain name of the hostname (for example returns the authoritative 
server for "mnc015.mcc234.gprs"). 
4. The local caching DNS server caches the response for a specified amount of time 
(specified by the root DNS server) and then re sends the query but to the 
authoritative DNS server as specified by the Root DNS server. The authoritative 
DNS server may reside in the same GRX/IPX provider's network (GRX1), another 
GRX/IPX provider's network (GRX2) or the network of the destination Mobile 
Network Operator (Service Provider 2). (Indeed, it may even reside in the requesting 
Service Provider's network!) 
5. The Authoritative DNS server responds to the query with the address of the 
hostname (or responds with a hostname, if a reverse lookup is being performed) to 
the Local Caching server in the requesting network (Service Provider 1). 
6. The Local Caching Server caches the response for a specified amount of time 
(specified by the authoritative server) and forwards it on to the Resolver. 


NOTE 1: The above shows only a typical message flow for DNS resolving on the 
GRX/IPX. It may take extra queries when an MNO has Multiple levels of 
authoritative DNS servers (see example below and section Error! 
Reference source not found.), or for such services/enablers as those that 
require ENUM. Please refer to section Error! Reference source not 
found. for more detailed information for each service, and section Error! 
Reference source not found. for more detailed information on ENUM. 

NOTE 2: In clause 7.11.21 (Section 17) IR.21 [49] provides for MNOs to directly 
exchange the IP addresses and DNS names of their authoritative DNS 
servers. This gives the option for an MNO who has received such 
information from another MNO to configure directly into their local caching 
servers the authoritative DNS servers IP addresses for the corresponding 
DNS names. 
When this option is used, and a query matching a configured DNS name is 
received, the interaction with the Root DNS server specified in steps 2-4 
above is bypassed. Instead the query is sent directly to the other operators 
authoritative DNS server, after which steps 5 and 6 follow. However if the 
local caching DNS server has cached the answer to the query, the answer 
is sent directly as specified in step 2. 

 


Instead of having a single Authoritative DNS, an Operator may choose to split the DNS into 
several levels of DNS for example a First Level DNS which may be authoritative for some of 
the domain names ÅgownedÅh by the MNO, and one or more Second Level Authoritative 
DNSes, which may be authoritative for different ÅgsubdomainnamesÅh. where for example a 
Second Level DNS may be outsourced to 3rd party service provider for a particular service.

1. Same as step 1 in the example above 
2. Same as step 2 in the example above 
3. Same as step 3 in the example above 
4. Same as step 4 in the example above 
5. The First Level Authoritative DNS server may be authoritative for the queried domain 
name, in which cases it responds to the query with the address of the hostname (or 
responds with a hostname, if a reverse lookup is being performed) to the Local 
Caching server in the requesting network (Service Provider 1). In this case the 
following step process continues with step 8. 


Alternatively for certain Ågsubdomain namesÅh, a second level DNS may be 
authoritative. In this case The First Level Authoritative DNS server returns a referral 
to the Second Level DNS server which is authoritative for the queried domain name 
of the hostname (for example returns the authoritative server for 
"<subdomainname>.mnc015.mcc234.gprs") 


6. The local caching DNS server caches the response for a specified amount of time 
(specified by the First Level Authoritative DNS server) and then re - sends the query 
to the Second Level Authoritative DNS server as specified by the First Level 
Authoritative DNS server. The 2nd Level Authoritative DNS server may reside in the 
same GRX/IPX provider's network (GRX1), another GRX/IPX provider's network 
(GRX2), the network of the destination Mobile Network Operator (Service Provider 
2), or in a 3rd Party Service Providers Network. 
7. The Second Level Authoritative DNS server may respond to the query with the 
address of the hostname (or responds with a hostname, if a reverse lookup is being 
performed) to the Local Caching server in the requesting network (Service Provider 
1). 
8. The Local Caching Server caches the response for a specified amount of time 
(specified by the authoritative server) and forwards it on to the Resolver. 


NOTE 3: It is recommended that no more than two Levels of Authoritative DNS (that 
is First Level and Second Level) are provisioned in a resolution "chain". 
However, an originating Service Provider for ENUM queries needs to be 
able to make at least as many queries as there are labels in the FQDN. 

NOTE 4: In case the option to directly configure the IP address of another operators 
DNS server is used as discussed in NOTE 2 above, only IP addresses of 
First Level Authoritative DNS Server should be configured. 

2.3 Domains 

2.3.1 Introduction 

The following sub-sections detail the domain names that can and cannot be used on the 
GRX/IPX network. 

In addition to this, the 3GPP have designated a specific sub domain for usage on the 
Internet's DNS to enable user equipment to locate a specific server on the Internet 
(terminals cannot see the GRX/IPX therefore a whole new sub domain had to be 
introduced). For more information on which domains used by 3GPP are intended for which 
network, see 3GPP TS 23.003 [8], Annex D. 

2.3.2 General 

Unlike the DNS on the Internet, the DNS on the GRX/IPX network is currently much "flatter". 
That is, there are not so many domains (and sub-domains of thereof), supported and 
provisioned in the GRX/IPX Root DNS Server. This inherently means that all domain names 
used by Service Providers and GRX/IPX Providers in any service that utilises the GRX/IPX 
network are limited to just the domain names detailed in section Error! Reference source 
not found. below. No other domain name formats are currently supported on the 
GRX/IPX network! This effectively means a limitation of domain names of ".gprs" and 
".3gppnetwork.org" at the higher level, and limited beneath to sub-domains of a format 
based on ITU-T recommendation E.212 [36] number ranges. 

For the ".gprs" domain name, so called "human friendly" sub-domains are also allowed, as 
specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [8], section 9. This consists of simply an FQDN reserved in the 


Internet domain name space e.g. serviceprovider.fi, serviceprovider.co.uk. However, such 
sub-domains of ".gprs" are not generally used in the GRX/IPX network and it is 
recommended not to use these as they can negatively affect GPRS/3G PS roaming. See 
section Error! Reference source not found. below for more details. 

More information on processes and procedures relating to domain names can be found in 
section Error! Reference source not found.. 

2.3.3 Domain names used on the GRX/IPX DNS 

The following provides a summary of the domain names that are used by Service Providers 
on private IP inter-connects and on the GRX/IPX network. These domain names are only 
resolvable by network equipment and not by end users. That is, they are exclusively used 
on the Network-Network Interface (NNI) and not on the User-Network Interface (UNI). 

Additional domain names that are resolvable on the GRX/IPX network's DNS may be added 
in the future. See section Error! Reference source not found. for more details. 

For more details about each domain name and/or sub-domain name, refer to the referenced 
documents.

2.3.5 Domain names used on the GRX/IPX DNS for UNI 

Only the domain name "ipxuni.3gppnetwork.org" is defined for domain names of this type 
(see 3GPP TS 23.003 [8]). However, there are currently no sub-domains reserved under this 
domain name. 

2.4 Non-service specific hostnames and domains 

Having a consistent naming convention makes it easier for tracing and trouble-shooting as 
well as easing the maintenance of Service Provider's DNS. The following convention is 
recommended to achieve these goals. Although the usage of this naming methodology is 
highly recommended, it is not mandated. 

Service Provider nodes should have names for each interface with the following format: 

<city>-<type>-<nbr> 

where: 

. <city> is the name, or shortened name, of the city/town (or closest, where applicable) 
where the node is located 
. <nbr> is a running number of similar devices at the same city (for DNS servers, use 0 
to indicate the primary DNS Server) 
. <type> describes device type and should be one of the following for GRX/IPX 
connected hosts: 
. dns - DNS/ENUM servers 
. ggsn 
. sgsn 
. rtr - router 
. fw - firewall 




Additional values for the <type> parameter are for further study for the GRX/IPX. For 
example, the following are valid hostnames for interfaces on Service Provider nodes: 

. helsinki-ggsn-4 


The domain name to append to hostnames for nodes belonging to Service Providers should 
be the following (see section Error! Reference source not found. for more details on the 
domain name formats): 

. node.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org 
. node.spn< SPN>.ipxsp.org 


A combination of the above domain names could be used by a Service Provider; however, 
for consistency it is better to use only one. 

The following are thus example Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) for interfaces on 
Service Provider nodes: 

. helsinki-ggsn-4.node.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org 



. london-dns-23.node.spn001.ipxsp.org 


Note that usage of the hostnames and sub-domains specified within this section under 
"mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.gprs" is now deprecated, and Service Providers are recommended 
to use either of "mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3ppgnetwork.org" or "spn<SPN>.ipxsp.org" 
domains at their earliest convenience. Of course, usage of "mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.gprs" 
for the uses as stated in section Error! Reference source not found., is not deprecated 
and should continue as per normal. 

2.5 Host names for the evolved packet Core (EPC) 

The naming of Nodes for the Evolved Packet Core is specified in clause 19 of 3GPP TS 
23.003 [8] 

 

2.6 Host names for the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) 

Withn the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) the following Naming Convention for IMS Nodes 
shall be used <Node name>.<SP Domain Name>, where 

. <Node name> may consist of one or more lables that uniquely identifies the IMS 
node within the Service Provider network. 


To avoid conflicts with future other subdomains to the <SP Domain Name> it can be 
considered good practice to include Åg.nodeÅh as the right-most label of the <Node 
Name> 

. <SP Domain Name> is a Domain Name that is owned by the Service provider. 


 Ågims.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.orgÅh is the recommended <SP Domain 
Name> for all IMS Nodes. 

Ågims.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.orgÅh must be used as <SP Domain Name> for 
IMS Nodes that are individually addressable over the IPX network by SIP or any other 
protocol, and where those Node Names need to be resolved over the IPX DNS system. 

Examples of IMS nodes that may need to be individually addressable, are all nodes that are 
addressed using a SIP Route Header, such as the nodes hosting the functionalities of a P-
CSCF, S-CSCF, TRF, ATCF, and eMSC-S for I2. 

3 General DNS Configuration for Service Providers 

3.1 Introduction 

This section gives some general information on DNS server configuration for operators. For 
information on configuring DNS servers for specific services, see sections Error! Reference 
source not found. and Error! Reference source not found.. 


3.2 DNS Server Hardware 

It is recommended that operators have physically separate Primary and Secondary DNS 
servers. This helps provide the greatest service availability and allows for e.g. upgrading 
DNS Servers without any service interruption. 

3.3 DNS Server Software 

Most commonly ISC BIND (usually version 4 or version 9) is the chosen software supplied 
by equipment vendors with any new service equipment that utilises a DNS Nameserver. 
Service Providers and IPX Providers should ensure that only the most secure version is 
used in their live networks, and all security patches are applied. Note that no particular 
version of BIND is recommended, because to do so here would provide potentially out of 
date information to the reader. 

Use of ISC BIND is fine for services which do not necessarily have a large data-fil (for 
example: GPRS, MMS) but for services such as ENUM where the data-fil can run into 
thousands, if not millions of resource records, a commercial DNS Nameserver product 
should be used. 

Such commercial DNS Namesserver solutions can also support legacy DNS data-fil (for 
example, that used for GPRS roaming), thereby consolidating all operator DNS needs. Note 
that it is out of the scope of this document, and the GSMA, to provide any recommendations 
on commercial DNS Nameservers. In fact, diversity of DNS software used by Service 
Providers and IPX Providers gives a better overall robustness of the DNS on GRX/IPX 
network. 

3.4 DNS Server naming 

All DNS servers need to have an FQDN assigned to them. For Service Provider DNS 
servers connected to the GRX/IPX, the naming conventions as specified in section Error! 
Reference source not found. shall be used. 

3.5 Domain Caching 

Since each service (e.g. GPRS, MMS etc.) has its own domain, a separate TTL value can be 
set per service. 

When setting the TTL value for a zone, careful consideration must be taken to ensure that 
the right trade-off is made between performance and consistency. A small TTL value results 
in a greater signalling overhead, greater processing overhead for the authoritative name 
server(s) and greater time for a returning a result (an example: GPRS PDP Context set-up 
time), but the data will be more up-to-date therefore allowing updates to propagate much 
more quickly. A large TTL value results in a smaller signalling overhead, smaller processor 
overhead for the authoritative name server(s) and usually shorter time for returning a result 
to the requesting entity, but the data will be more likely to be out of date and therefore 
resulting in updates taking longer to propagate. 

It is highly recommended that negative caching is also used (available in ISC BIND versions 
4.9, 8.x and 9.x and should be available in most commercial DNS solutions). Again, careful 


consideration should be taken, considering factors such as the frequency of updates, 
signalling overhead and processing overhead of the authoritative DNS server for the domain. 

3.6 Reverse Mapping 

Each operator is strongly recommended to provide PTR (Pointer) records for all IP 
addresses that FQDNs refer to, for example for APNs, MMSC addresses and so on. This is 
not needed for inter-working to be successful, but rather, is recommended as it aids in 
trouble shooting/debugging activities such as performing a "traceroute". 

Reverse mapping for IPv4 addressing uses the "in-addr.arpa" domain, and reverse mapping 
for IPv6 addressing uses "ip6.arpa". See section Error! Reference source not found. for 
more information. 

3.7 Use of DNS Interrogation Modes 

Two interrogation modes are defined in the DNS specifications: iterative and recursive. 

In Iterative mode, a DNS server interrogates each DNS server in the hierarchy itself, in order 
to resolve the requested domain name. In Recursive Mode, a DNS server interrogates only 
the next DNS server in the DNS hierarchy. That DNS Server then takes on responsibility for 
resolving the requested domain name and provides a final answer back to the original 
requesting DNS server. Error! Reference source not found. below depicts both iterative 
and recursive queries: 

 

 
125634125346

Figure 4: Iterative (left) and Recursive (Right) modes of DNS querying 


Only Iterative DNS queries shall be used within the GRX/IPX. This not only saves on DNS 
Server load but also to enables visibility of the source of the original request at the 
destination, which is lost when using recursive queries. 

If any recursive DNS queries are received by a DNS Server then they should be ignored. 
The only elements that should issue recursive DNS queries are service nodes issuing DNS 
requests to their Local Caching DNS Servers e.g. an SGSN querying its Local Caching DNS 


Server for an APN (see section Error! Reference source not found. for more information 
on GPRS, including APN resolution). 

3.8 Use of the GRX/IPX Root DNS Server 

There are two possibilities to arrange DNS hierarchy. The first is for each Service Provider to 
configure their own authoritative DNS Server for each domain name that needs to be 
resolved for all inter-working and roaming partner Service Providers. The draw-back of this 
approach is that it is not scalable because every time a new inter-working and/or roaming 
partner agreement is made, or even any existing inter-working and/or roaming partner's DNS 
Server details change, the aforementioned authoritative DNS Server must be updated 
accordingly. Thus, this could be a potential operational intensive task, and most likely a 
frequent source for inter-working and roaming problems. This alternative may be fine for 
small Service Providers with few interworking and/or roaming partners, but is not 
recommended due to the reasons stated. Therefore, this alternative is not further detailed in 
the present document. 

Another alternative is to use the common GRX/IPX Root DNS Server, as provided for by the 
GRX/IPX service provider (see section Error! Reference source not found. for more detail 
on this architecture). Using the GRX/IPX Root DNS Server enables modified DNS Server 
details for a Service Provider to automatically propagate to all interworking and roaming 
partners (subject to caching time). This alternative is the recommended one, and is thus the 
assumed deployment of authoritative DNS Servers in the rest of the present document. 

3.9 Provisioning of Service Provider's DNS servers 

Service Providers should take care to share all appropriate data to enable all 
roaming/inter-working partners routing to an authoritative DNS Server, that is a DNS Server 
where their own domain names can be resolved by others. GSMA IR.21 (PRD or GSMA 
InfoCentre database) and the GRX/IPX Root DNS should be used to ease such sharing of 
data, wherever possible. 

Service Providers can provision authoritative DNS Servers themselves or outsource to 
another entity for example their GRX/IPX Provider. 

Service providers may have all appropriate data available in a single level of authoritative 
DNS servers, where each authoritative DNS server holds all the appropriate data for the 
Service Provider. 

Alternatively, Service Providers may choose to divide the appropriate data between a First 
level Authoritative DNS Servers and 2nd Level Authoritative DNS Servers whereby each 
2nd-level Authoritative DNS server only holds a subset of the appropriate data for the 
Service provider. 

When information about DNS servers are exchanged with the GRX/IPX Root DNS and other 
Service Providers for example via PRD IR.21, and when 2nd-Level Authoritative DNS server 
are used, it is essential to make a clear distinction between the First level Authoritative DNS 
servers and 2nd-Level Authoritative DNS servers. This is to ensure that only First level 
Authoritative DNS server are published in the GRX/IPX Root DNS such that the first query to 
an Operators DNS always goes the First level Authoritative DNS and that the second level 


DNS servers are reached only by means of referrals from the First Level Authoritative DNS 
server. 

3.10 Resource Records 

Service Providers and IPX Providers should take care to provision only the DNS Resource 
Records (RRs) that are necessary for service interworking, trouble shooting and O&M 
(Operations & Maintenance). 

3.11 Support for IPv4 and IPv6 

Support for IPv4 and IPv6 on Service Provider DNS Nameservers is twofold: the ability to 
serve data relating to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and connectivity to/from the nameserver. 

For configuration information in a Nameserver, both IPv4 and IPv6 information can coexist 
together. Service Providers just need to ensure that the Nameserver software used is 
capable of supporting the relevant Resource Records (RR) required. The "A" RR is used to 
hold IPv4 address information and the "AAAA" RR for IPv6 address information. Details on 
reverse mapping (IPv4/IPv6 address to domain name) are specified in section Error! 
Reference source not found.. 

For connectivity to a Nameserver, it is highly recommended that all Service Provider 
Nameservers be reachable using IPv4. Any Nameservers serving IPv6 information should 
also be reachable using IPv6. 

See GSMA PRD IR.34 [12] and GSMA PRD IR.40 [42] for more information on 
recommendations relating to IPv4 and IPv6 routing and addressing. 

4 DNS Aspects for Standardised Services 

4.1 Introduction 

This section describes the DNS aspects of standardised services that utilise DNS. 
Recommendations are made, where appropriate, beyond what is defined in the referenced 
specifications in order to promote easier service interworking for Service Providers. The list 
of services below is not exhaustive and other services that utilise DNS on the GRX/IPX can 
be used. 

If there are discrepancies between the description of the services and the referenced 
specifications in the following sub-sections, what is stated in the referenced specifications 
shall prevail. 

4.2 General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) 

4.2.1 Introduction 

GPRS provides for a packet switched bearer in GSM/UMTS networks. Packets are tunnelled 
between core network nodes that may or may not be in different PLMNs, using the GPRS 
Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.060 [24]. 


Note that in UMTS, GPRS is referred to as "Packet Switched" access, however, this is just a 
naming convention, and the mechanism remains the same. 

For more information on GPRS/Packet Switched access, see GSMA PRD IR.33 [39], 3GPP 
TS 23.060 [26], and 3GPP TS 29.060 [24]. 

4.2.2 APN resolution in PDP Context activation 

PDP Context activations occur between the SGSN and the GGSN. PDP Contexts are 
activated to an Access Point Name either provided by the MS, or derived by the network 
(such as when the MS instructs the SGSN to use a "default" APN). It is the APN that 
determines to which interface on which GGSN the PDP Context is to be established. See 
section Error! Reference source not found. for the format of APNs. Further details on the 
APN can be found in GSMA PRD IR.33 [39]. 

An SGSN and a GGSN can be located in either the HPLMN or VPLMN. Both are in the 
same network when the subscriber is in the HPLMN and also when the subscriber is 
roaming in a VPLMN and is using a GGSN in the VPLMN (vGGSN). However, the SGSN 
and GGSN are in different networks when the subscriber is roaming but using a GGSN in 
the HPLMN (hGGSN). 

GPRS roaming means the extension of packet switched services offered in the Home PLMN 
to Visited PLMNs with which the HPLMN has a predefined commercial roaming agreement. 

The necessary DNS queries for resolving an APN in order to activate a PDP Context are 
described below. Note that the Authoritative DNS Server is usually located in the same 
PLMN as the GGSN, but can be located elsewhere, for example, in the HPLMN's GRX/IPX 
provider's network (due to the HPLMN outsourcing the Authoritative DNS Server).

Figure 5: DNS message flow for PDP Context activations 
1. Upon receiving a "PDP Context Activation" message from the MS, the SGSN checks the 
APN (if one was provided) against the user subscription record it previously obtained 
from the HLR when the MS attached, and then sends a recursive DNS Query to the DNS 
Local Caching DNS server. 
2. The Local Caching DNS Server checks its local cache for the IP address of the 
requested FQDN. If it has this, processing skips to step 6. Otherwise, the Local Caching 
DNS Server checks its local cache for the IP address of the Authoritative DNS Server. If 
it does not already have this IP address, it then issues an iterative DNS Query to the 
Root DNS Server otherwise, processing skips to step 4. 
3. The Root DNS Server replies to the DNS Query received from the Local Caching DNS 
with the details of the Authoritative DNS Server (for example, the FQDN and/or IP 
address(es). 
4. The Local Caching DNS Server sends an iterative DNS Query to the Authoritative DNS 
Server (which will reside in the VPLMN, for vGGSN connection, and will reside in the 
HPLMN for hGGSN connection). 
5. The Authoritative DNS Server replies to DNS Query received from the Local Caching 
DNS Server with the IP address of the GGSN. 
6. The Local Caching DNS Server replies to the DNS Query received from the SGSN (in 
step 1) with the result obtained from the Authoritative DNS Server. The SGSN then 
commences GTP tunnel establishment and, all being well, data flow starts.

As can be seen in the above steps, there are less DNS queries for a subscriber using a 
GGSN in the VPLMN as the Root DNS Server is not interrogated. 

Note also that the Local Caching DNS Server could also be the Authoritative DNS Server for 
the requested FQDN, in which case a final result can be given immediately to the SGSN. 

4.2.3 Inter-SGSN handovers for active PDP Contexts 

When an MS has one or more PDP Contexts activated and moves to a new Routing Area 
that is serviced by a new SGSN, the new SGSN needs to connect to the old SGSN in order 
to download the PDP Context information and any data that is still to be delivered to the MS. 
It can do this by either using a mapping table which has SGSN addresses against a finite set 
of Routing Areas, or it can translate the old Routing Area Code (as received from the MS) 
into a FQDN upon which to resolve to an IP address using DNS. 

The former method is most commonly used for intra-PLMN SGSN handovers, and the latter 
is used for inter-PLMN SGSN handovers. However, both methods can be used for both 
types of handovers. 

The latter of the two aforementioned methods is depicted below for inter- and intra-PLMN 
SGSN handovers. The FQDN created by the SGSN depends upon whether the SGSN 
handover is a Routing Area Update, Routing Area Update in a network which has Intra 
Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes or is an SRNS Relocation (see 
3GPP TS 23.060 [23], section 6.9, for more information). 

 

Figure 6: DNS message flow for PDP Context handovers between SGSNs 



7. The new SGSN creates an FQDN using the old Routing Area Code (and the Network 
Resource Identifier, if available) or the old RNC ID and then issues a recursive DNS 
Query to the DNS server address configured in the SGSN (Local Caching DNS server). 
8. The Local Caching DNS Server checks its local cache for the IP address of the 
requested FQDN. If it has this, processing skips to step 6. Otherwise, the Local Caching 
DNS Server checks its local cache for the IP address of the Authoritative DNS Server. If 
it does not already have this IP address, it then issues an iterative DNS Query to the 
Root DNS Server, otherwise, processing skips to step 4. 
9. The Root DNS Server replies to the DNS Query received from the Local Caching DNS 
with the details of the Authoritative DNS Server (for example, the FQDN and/or IP 
address(es)). 
10. The Local Caching DNS Server sends an iterative DNS Query to the Authoritative DNS 
Server (which will reside in the VPLMN, for inter-PLMN handover, and will reside in the 
HPLMN for intra-PLMN handover). 
11. The Authoritative DNS Server replies to DNS Query received from the Local Caching 
DNS Server with the IP address of the old SGSN. 
12. The Local Caching DNS Server replies to the DNS Query received from the SGSN (in 
step 1) with the result obtained from the Authoritative DNS Server. The New SGSN then 
commences handover with the Old SGSN. 


As can be seen in the above steps, there are less DNS queries for an intra-PLMN SGSN 
handover as the Root DNS Server is not interrogated. 

Note also that the Local Caching DNS Server could also be the Authoritative DNS Server for 
the requested FQDN, in which case a final result can be given immediately to the New 
SGSN. 

4.3 Multi-media Messaging Service (MMS) 

4.3.1 Introduction 

MMS inter-working is where a subscriber of one operator has the ability to send and receive 
Multimedia Messages (MMs) to and from a subscriber of another operator. Unlike SMS inter-
working, the MM is always sent to the user via his ÅghomeÅh service centre. This means that in 
all MMS inter-working scenarios, the MM is always transferred from the source operatorÅfs 
MMSC to the destination operatorÅfs MMSC. Thus, MMS interworking requires use of a 
standardised inter-MMSC protocol. This protocol is defined as SMTP (defined in IETF RFC 
2821[13]) as profiled in the MMS specification 3GPP TS 23.140 [15]. 

DNS is used in MMS in order for the source MMSC to resolve the destination MMSC/SMTP 
server. DNS MX Resource Records, as defined in IETF RFC 1035 [2], are required for 
SMTP based Multimedia Message routeing and relaying. It should be noted that GSMA PRD 
IR.34 [12] recommends that the ".gprs" TLD should be used when utilising the GRX/IPX 
network as the interworking network between MMSCs. This format of FQDN, including 
allowed sub-domains, is defined in section Error! Reference source not found. of the 
present document.

DNS ServerOperator BRoot DNS 
ServerAuthoritative 
DNS ServerMMSC124SMTP Message Transfer procedure356
The selection of a DNS tree/hierarchy to use (e.g. Internet or GRX/IPX) ultimately depends 
on the interconnection network used. The interconnection network used can in turn depend 
on where the MM is to be sent e.g. Internet for when delivering to an e-mail user, GRX/IPX 
network for when delivering to another MMS subscriber. Thus, the resolution process may 
differ depending on whether the MM is addressed to an MSISDN/E.164 number or to an 
NAI/e-mail address. 

There are also different commercial models for MMS inter-working between Operators. 
These are essentially the "Direct Interconnect" model, where MMs are sent from Operator A 
to Operator B directly, and the "Indirect Interconnect Model", where MMs are sent from 
Operator A to an MMS Hub (and the MMS Hub then takes care of delivering the MM to 
Operator B). 

More information on MMS interworking can be found in GSMA PRD IR.52 [9]. 

4.3.2 MM delivery based on MSISDN for the Direct Interconnect model 

The following figure and associated numbered steps describe the direct interconnect only 
scenario for MMS inter-working of MMs addressed to an MSISDN/E.164 number: 

 

Figure 7: MMS Direct Inter-network Delivery 
1. Upon receiving a Multimedia Message (MM) from the MS, the MMSC converts the 
destination MSISDN to an MMS FQDN (commonly of the form 
"mms.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.gprs") by using one of the following methods: 



. An HLR look-up using e.g. the MAP_SRI_For_SM operation. This returns the IMSI, of 
which the MNC and MCC are extracted to create the MMS FQDN. 
. An ENUM look-up (see section Error! Reference source not found. for more 
details). 


The MMSC then sends a recursive DNS query for the derived FQDN to the Local 
Caching DNS Server. 

2. The Local Caching DNS Server checks its local cache for the IP address of the 
requested FQDN. If it has this, processing skips to step 6. Otherwise, the Local Caching 
DNS Server checks its local cache for the IP address of the Authoritative DNS Server. If 
it does not already have this IP address, it then issues an iterative DNS Query to the 
Root DNS Server, otherwise processing skips to step 4. 
3. The Root DNS Server replies to the DNS Query received from the Local Caching DNS 
Server with the details of the Authoritative DNS Server (for example, the FQDN and/or IP 
address(es)). 
4. The Local Caching DNS Server sends an iterative DNS Query to the Authoritative DNS 
Server. 
5. The Authoritative DNS Server replies to the DNS Query received from the Local Caching 
DNS Server with the IP address of the MMSC, or, a list of FQDNs and/or IP addresses if 
the query was for an MX record. 
6. The Local Caching DNS Server replies to the DNS Query received from the MMSC (in 
step 1) with the result obtained from the Authoritative DNS Server. The MMSC then 
commences an SMTP session with Operator B's MMSC to transfer the MM. 


Note that the Local Caching DNS Server could also be the Authoritative DNS Server for the 
requested FQDN, in which case a final result can be given immediately to the MMSC. 

4.3.3 MM delivery based on MSISDN for the Indirect Interconnect model

this model, the Authoritative DNS Server is always known. 
3. The Authoritative DNS Server replies to the DNS Query received from the Local Caching 
DNS Server with either the IP address of the MMS Hub to use or the destination MMSC, 
or, a list of FQDNs and/or IP addresses if the query was for an MX record. 
4. The Local Caching DNS Server replies to the DNS Query received from the MMSC (in 
step 1) with the result obtained from the Authoritative DNS Server. The MMSC then 
commences an SMTP session either with Operator B's MMSC, or, to an identified MMS 
Hub, to transfer the MM. 


Note that there is more flexibility in the MMS Hub architecture than shown above, depending 
on the MMS Hub provider used e.g. some Hub providers offer MSISDN/E.164 number 


conversion/resolving, some offer complete hosting of the MMSC, and so on. See GSMA 
PRD IR.52 [9] for more information on MM delivery using an MMS Hub, including a more full 
description of the flexibility available in the architecture. 

Note also that the Local Caching DNS Server could also be the Authoritative DNS Server for 
the requested FQDN, in which case a final result can be given immediately to the MMSC. 

4.3.4 MM delivery based on NAI/e-mail address 

For MMs addressed to an NAI/e-mail address (as defined in IETF RFC 2822 [15]), the 
message flow is the same as in Error! Reference source not found. except that the 
Internet's root DNS servers and authoritative DNS servers are used, possibly with the use of 
referral DNS servers too. 

4.4 WLAN Inter-working 

4.4.1 Introduction 

Error! Reference source not found. shows how local login and roaming login differ; it also 
demonstrates how Roaming Partners actually connect to each other via inter-operator 
network. Case 1 is an example of normal local login in the hot spot of Visited PLMN, where 
the user inserts his username & password and is authenticated in the Visited PLMN. In this 
case, the RADIUS Roaming Network is not utilised. 

Case 2 in Error! Reference source not found. refers to a roaming login, where the user 
inserts his username (with realm) and password in the hot spot of the Visited PLMN and 
authentication and request is sent by way of a proxy to Home PLMN. The User is then 
authenticated in the Home PLMN. Necessary RADIUS messages are transferred between 
RADIUS Roaming Proxies using the IP based Inter-PLMN network, that is, the GRX/IPX. 

Error! Reference source not found. shows also in principle the difference between the 
following two authentication methods: 

. Web Based Authentication 
. SIM Based Authentication 


Web Based (that is, using username/password) authentication is considered as an existing 
first phase solution for the WLAN authentication. However, in the future there will be a target 
solution utilising EAP solutions, where the Home PLMN HLR is involved. 


 

Figure 9: WLAN user authentication mechanism 


The GRX/IPX network is used for transporting RADIUS authentication and accounting 
messages for WLAN roaming services only, WLAN user data is not carried over GRX/IPX. 

The IP address of the WLAN Roaming Proxy must be reachable via the GRX/IPX. Please 
note that the first phase of WLAN roaming will not use the GRX/IPX Root DNS at all since 
the IP addresses of the Home PLMN RADIUS server is statically configured in the Visited 
PLMNs RADIUS server (the "next hop" list). In fact, RADIUS does not provide for a DNS 
type solution for realm to AAA entity mapping. The utilising of Root DNS may be required in 
future WLAN roaming solutions where Diameter instead of RADIUS is used, as Diameter 
does provide for an optional realm to AAA entity mapping. 

More information on WLAN roaming can be found in GSMA PRD IR.61 [10]. 

4.5 IP Multi-media core network Sub-system (IMS) 

4.5.1 Introduction 

The IP Multi-media core network Sub-system (IMS) provides a standardised architecture for 
providing feature rich, multimedia services/applications, such as speech communication, 
real-time and turn-based gaming, shared online whiteboards etc. IMS services/applications 
rely on sessions managed by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), as defined in IETF RFC 
3261 [38], and profiled in 3GPP TS 24.229 [35] (which includes a set of standardised 
extensions) for use by Service Providers. 


Diameter is also used on some interfaces in the IMS architecture, however, these are 
intra-Service Provider interfaces and so are outside the scope of this PRD. 

Error! Reference source not found. shows an end-to-end IMS session. Only the basic 
architecture of involved IMS network elements is shown. Please note that signalling and user 
data of an IMS session are separated. Signalling and user data make use of different PDP 
contexts, but use the same (originating) IP address.

Figure 10: IMS Session Inter-working 


IMS subscribers are addressed by SIP URIs or E.164 numbers represented as Tel URIs or 
SIP URIs with the "user=phone" option. ENUM is specified in IMS as the means to convert 
an E.164 number into a SIP URI. See section Error! Reference source not found. for more 
information on ENUM. 

For resolving SIP URIs to SIP Servers (see IETF RFC 3263 [17]), support of the NAPTR 
Resource Record functionality (as defined in IETF RFC 3404 [6]) and SRV Resource Record 
functionality (as defined in IETF RFC 2782 [18]) is needed in a Service Provider's DNS 
servers. 

More information on IMS roaming and interworking can be found in GSMA PRD IR.65 [11]. 

4.5.2 SIP server configuration 

There are several RFCs covering use of SIP in the DNS. These include IETF RFC 3824 
[24], IETF RFC 3263 [17], and IETF RFC 3403 [6]. 

The reason this configuration is needed is as follows: 

When a SIP session is initiated by a user, they address the session to either a SIP URI (e.g. 
kim@example.com) or an E.164 number. In both cases, the IMS needs to know the IP 
address of the SIP server to which it can route the session. The SIP server information 
contains the detail needed to provide the destination network's SIP server IP address to the 
calling network based on the information in the SIP URI. 


The approach described in this section is compliant with these RFCs and consists of 4 
separate steps. It is consequently known as the Åg4-step approachÅh. 

In order to improve performance/session establishment time, use of explicit IP addresses 
instead of FQDNs eliminates the need for some DNS lookups and retains compatibility with 
existing standards. However, using IP addresses instead of FQDNs is more restrictive. 

4.5.2.1 Step 1 

This is the ENUM related step and is performed only for cases where the service has been 
addressed to an E.164 number. An IMS call to a user using the format bob@example.com 
would not require this step. Example of DNS data for a particular SIP URI and its servers 
can be found in section Error! Reference source not found. 

4.5.2.2 Step 2 

Having obtained the destination domain name the DNS is asked to provide matching SIP 
Server Location Information. One or more NAPTR records may be retrieved and the calling 
application examines these records to find the best match based on priorities and the 
desired SIP protocol variant: 

mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org. IN NAPTR 50 100 "s" "SIP+D2U" "" _sip._udp.example.com. 

mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org. IN NAPTR 90 100 "s" "SIP+D2T" "" _sip._tcp.example.com. 

mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org. IN NAPTR 90 100 "s" "SIPS+D2T" "" _sips._tcp.example.com. 

 

In the above example, ÅgD2UÅh indicates UDP-based SIP, ÅgD2TÅh indicates TCP-based SIP, 
and ÅgSIPS+D2TÅh indicates UDP-based unencrypted SIP. 

The presence of these fields indicates what variations of SIP are supported on a given SIP 
server. 

The "s" flag means the next stage is to look up an "SRV" record 

4.5.2.3 Step 3 

An example set of SIP server SRV records is as follows: 

_sip._tcp.example.com. SRV 0 1 5060 sipserv1.example.com. 

_sip._tcp.example.com. SRV 0 2 5060 sipserv2.example.com. 

_sip._udp.example.com. SRV 0 1 5060 sipserv1.example.com. 

_sip._udp.example.com. SRV 0 2 5060 sipserv2.example.com. 

_sips._tcp.example.com. SRV 0 1 5060 sipserv3.example.com. 

_sips._tcp.example.com. SRV 0 2 5060 sipserv4.example.com. 

 

For each of the variations of the SIP protocols supported the SRV records describe: 

. name of the server; 
. which port number SIP uses; and 
. where there are multiple servers, the weights & priorities to allow rough load balancing. 


The calling network asks the DNS for a SRV record for the host corresponding to the specific 
service/protocol/domain combination that was returned in Step 2 


If there are multiple records with the same service/protocol/domain combination, the caller 
must sort the records based on which has the lowest priority. If there is more than one 
record with the same priority, the record with the highest weight is chosen. 

From the SRV record get the corresponding server name. 

There is potential flexibility in this step for the destination operator to receive the SIP traffic 
on different servers depending on the desired variation of the SIP protocol . TCP, UDP, 
encrypted, unencrypted. 

4.5.2.4 Step 4 

For the server name returned in Step 3, do a standard DNS lookup to finds its IP address 

This is a normal "A" (address) record lookup 

sipserv1.example.com. IN A 101.1.2.3 

sipserv2.example.com. IN A 101.1.2.4 

4.5.3 Domain Names used 

The domain names used for IMS based services are SIP Server names, however, there are 
no restrictions in the standards as to what these domain names shall be (other than the 
normal FQDN rules, as specified in the likes of IETF RFC 1034 [1] and IETF RFC 1035 [2]). 
However, for service providers interconnecting across the GRX/IPX network, it is 
recommended to use an MCC/MNC sub domain of ".3gppnetwork.org" as this is supported 
already on the GRX/IPX DNS and also allows for SIP URIs returned using ENUM on the 
GRX/IPX as specified in section Error! Reference source not found.. 

It should be noted that right now, more "user friendly" domain names are not yet directly 
supported on the GRX/IPX DNS. Work on supporting a much wider set of domain names is 
ongoing. 

4.6 Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA) 

4.6.1 Introduction 

The Generic Authentication Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 33.220 [19]. It is a 
standardised mechanism for securely distributing shared keys for later use by applications 
on the UE. 

NOTE: The address of the Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) used by the UE is 
dependent on whether USIM or ISIM is used in bootstrapping. See 3GPP TS 
23.003 [8], section 16. 

4.7 Generic Access Network (GAN) 

4.7.1 Introduction 

The Generic Access Network is defined in 3GPP TS 43.318 [20] and 3GPP TS 44.318 [21]. 
It provides for using unlicensed radio spectrum for accessing the GSM core network in order 
to provide normal GSM services including both CS and PS. It was based on the work done 
by the UMA forum. 


4.8 Secure User Plane Location (SUPL) 

4.8.1 Introduction 

The Secure User Plane Location feature is defined in OMA 
OMA-AD-SUPL-V1_0-20070615-A [27]. It provides a mechanism for carrying location 
information between a user's SUPL Enabled Terminal (SET) and SUPL Location Platform 
(SLP) in a Service Provider's network, in a way that does not rely on modifications to any 
network interfaces or elements between the SET and SPL. This information can then be 
used by the Service Provider to calculate the SET's location. 

4.9 Enhanced Packet Core (EPC) 

4.9.1 Introduction 

The Enhanced Packet Core is defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [28] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [29]. It 
provides for a new and much more efficient PS core network to support E-UTRAN and 
serves as part of the Enhanced Packet System (EPS). 

It should be noted that EPC used to be known as SAE (Service Architecture Evolution) and 
E-UTRAN used to be known as LTE (Long Term Evolution) RAN. 

4.10 IMS Centralised Services (ICS) 

4.10.1 Introduction 

The IMS Centralised Services feature is defined in 3GPP TS 23.292 [30]. It enables the 
provisioning of Supplementary Services and value added services (such as those offered 
today via CAMEL) to the CS domain from IMS. 

4.11 Access Network Discovery Support Function (ANDSF) 

4.11.1 Introduction 

The Access Network Discovery Support Function (ANDSF) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.402 
[29]. It contains data management and control functionality necessary to provide network 
discovery and selection assistance data according to Service Provider policy. The ANDSF 
responds to requests from the UE for access network discovery information and may be able 
to initiate data transfer to the UE, based on network triggers. 

4.12 Mobile Broadcast Services (BCAST) 

4.12.1 Introduction 

Mobile Broadcast Services is a service enabler defined by the OMA in 
OMA-TS-BCAST_Service_Guide-V1_1-20100111-D [40]. This enables service/content 
providers to describe the services and content available (either free, subscription or one-off 
fee) and how to access them as Mobile Broadcast services either over a Broadcast Channel 
or over an Interaction Channel. From the user perspective the Service Guide can be seen as 
an entry point to discover the currently available or scheduled services and content, and to 
filter those based on their preferences. 


Discovery of a Service Guide Function is performed using DNS SRV records, or optionally, 
using an FQDN derived from the IMSI, as specified in section 6.2.1 of 
OMA-TS-BCAST_Service_Guide-V1_1-20100111-D [40]. The domain name to use when 
deriving the FQDN from the IMSI is specified in section Error! Reference source not 
found. of the present document. 

4.13 The XCAP Root URI on Ut Interface for MMTEL/IMS profile for Voice and 
SMS (XCAP) 

4.13.1 Introduction 

XCAP is a protocol defined in IETF RFC 4825 [44], 3GPP TS 24.623 [45], and is part of the 
IMS profile for Voice and SMS documented in IR.92 [46]. This is used in manipulation of 
supplementary service configuration. 

The XCAP Root URI is defined in IETF RFC 4825 [44], and is used to identify the XCAP 
Root, which is a context that contains all the documents across all application usages and 
users that are managed by the XCAP server. 

The XCAP Root URI takes the following format: 

"http://xcap.domain" 

The domain part of the XCAP Root URI is derived in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.003 [8], 
section 13.9. 

4.14 RCS - Rich Communication Suite 

4.14.1 4.14.1 Introduction 

RCS/RCS-e as specified in the RCS/RCS-e specifications [48] is a simple and interoperable 
evolution to voice and text, which enables customers to send instant messages, video chat 
and exchange files in real time, that is rich call with content sharing, chat, file sharing etc. All 
functions are built into the address book of mobile devices. RCS/RCS-e focuses on the 
communications service aspects building on established interoperability principles within the 
mobile operator ecosystem providing service definition, functional description and technical 
realisation to develop new service packages for today's 'always-on' mobile users enabling 
seamless user experience. 

The description and the use of the reserved subdomain names will be referenced in the 
RCS/RCS-e specifications where this domain can be used by all RCS/RCS-e specification 
versions. 

4.15 Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG) 

4.15.1 Introduction 

The Evolved Packet Data Gateway is defined in 3GPP TS 23.402 [29]. It provides PDN 
connectivity to the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) over untrusted non-3GPP IP access 
networks. 


4.16 Network element self-configuration 

4.16.1 Introduction 

The concept of network element self-configuration is described in 3GPP TS 32.501 [50]. The 
network elements self-configuration can be applied e.g. for eNBs that is defined in 3GPP TS 
36.300 [51]. 

4.17 EPC and GPRS coexistence 

4.17.1 Introduction 

When configuring the authoritative DNS server, a mobile operator supporting both GPRS 
and EPC roaming must consider that different DNS query procedures can be used in GPRS 
(A/AAAA-record queries) compared with EPC (S-NAPTR queries). 

GSMA PRD IR.88 [52] provides further details on the DNS configuration requirements for 
different GPRS (2G/3G) and EPC coexistence scenarios. 

4.18 MBMS Service Announcement Bootstrapping 

4.18.1 Introduction 

The method for bootstrapping for MBMS service announcement is described in 3GPP TS 
26.346 [53] 

5 E.164 Number Translation 

5.1 Introduction 

Telephone numbers compliant with E.164 that identify subscribers cannot be used on their 
own for addressing in IP based networks. The Internet Engineering Task Force have defined 
a mechanism for converting E.164 numbers to an "IP friendly" address relevant to the 
service that the user wishes to use. IETF RFC 3761 [3] defines the mapping of E.164 
numbers to services using DNS. This mechanism is known as ENUM. 

ENUM only provides for E.164 numbers (as defined in ITU-T Recommendation E.164 [37]), 
that is, telephone numbers in their full/international format of CC+NDC+SN. If a given dialled 
number is not in the E.164 number format for example national format, it needs to be 
converted to this format first. If a given dialled number is a short code or some other type of 
Service Provider address, it will need to be mapped to an E.164 number, or else, be 
resolved by a defined reverse lookup function to an E.164 number. 

There are two types of ENUM: Public ENUM and Private ENUM. There are a number of 
different terms used in the Telecommunications industry to refer to private ENUM. For 
example: ÅgCarrier ENUMÅh, ÅgInfrastructure ENUMÅh and "Operator ENUM". This document 
uses the term ÅgCarrier ENUMÅh. 

Public ENUM has the following characteristics: 

. Uses the public internet DNS infrastructure. 



. End User data is exposed to the Ågpublic" and can be read by anyone. 
. Uses the Åge164.arpaÅh top level domain. 
. Intention is to provide an on-line end user opt in service and application directory. 
. Data populated by end users who choose to opt-in and populate their data. 
. Data required to be managed by end user and could be out of date because it is up to 
the end user to keep it up to date. 
. May contain ÅgpersonalÅh data if the user desires. There are privacy concerns but placing 
this data in ENUM is according to user choice. 


Carrier ENUM has the following characteristics: 

. Uses a private DNS infrastructure 
. Provides a private routeing enabling technology that is transparent to the end user. 
. Cannot be directly accessed by end users or public Internet users as data is contained 
within a secure end-to-end network. 
. Uses a different top level domain to avoid any detrimental effects caused by unintended 
leakage to the Internet caused by mis-configuration in a Service ProviderÅfs network. 
. Data can be only be exchanged by those connected to the private routing infrastructure. 
. Data populated by Service Providers who are the telephone number assignee or their 
designated Agents. 
. Data must follow DNS caching and Time To Live requirements so as to avoid 
call/session failure. 
. Contains only data required for call/session routing or network discovery to the 
destination Service Provider. 


Public ENUM cannot be used on the GRX/IPX network, as it is too insecure, incomplete, 
non-private and has no guaranteed QoS or integrity of data. Therefore, Carrier ENUM 
should be used on the GRX/IPX network. The following sub-sections describe how Carrier 
ENUM is implemented in the GRX/IPX network for inter-Service Provider services (referred 
to hereafter as "Carrier ENUM on the GRX/IPX"). 

5.2 General Requirements 

Carrier ENUM on the GRX/IPX is designed to provide the following high-level requirements: 

. A competitive environment, where more than one vendor or service bureau can offer 
ENUM functionality. 
. Equal accessibility, such that the ENUM data fill is available to all entities that need it but 
also restricted to those that do not in a way that does not disadvantage them. 
. Accuracy in the data populated, in that existing authoritative databases with the required 
information are accessible to query. 
. Support for the establishment of permissions and/or reciprocal business policy 
agreements between Service Providers to determine routing and priorities for managing 
differing types of network traffic requesting access into a terminating Service Provider's 
network along with the need to identify the querying party. 


More lower-level/detailed requirements are contained within relevant sub-sections of section 
5, below. 


5.3 Architecture 

5.3.1 Introduction 

The following details the GSMA recommended structure and delegation model of Carrier 
ENUM on the GRX/IPX network. An alternative model is described in Error! Reference 
source not found., for Service Providers who want to provide their own ENUM solution. 
Analysis on the appropriateness and viability of each model (including how they can both 
co-exist) is provided in IN.12 [31]. 

In the following architecture model, a hierarchy of ownership is defined. DNS is designed to 
have a hierarchical structure allowing control of different parts of the overall structure to be 
established by business policy and data access requirements of the destination network 
whilst supporting standard DNS tiers. E.164 numbers also have a hierarchical structure and 
this can be mapped onto the DNS structure on the GRX/IPX network. 

5.3.2 Data Delegation Structure 

To ensure proper distribution and scalability of the DNS structures, ENUM was originally 
designed to use a strict tiered system, consisting of 3 tiers as follows: 

. Tier 0 . Global level 
. Authoritative for the ENUM top level domain. 
. Under this domain are pointers to the Tier 1 authoritative servers. 




. Tier 1 . Country Code level (CC) 
. Authoritative for ITU-T assigned E.164 country codes. 
. Under this domain are pointers to the Tier 2 authoritative servers. 




. Tier 2 . Service Provider level (NDC) 
. Authoritative for National Destination Codes and individual Subscriber 
Numbers. 
. Under this domain are the individual Subscriber Numbers each with one or 
more (Naming Authority Pointer) NAPTR records associated with them. 






This is depicted as follows, where the arrows show delegation:

Figure 11: ENUM logical hierarchy 


The ENUM hierarchy described above is logical, and does not require that each logical 
ENUM Tier is mapped to individual ENUM servers. The logical architecture allows for a large 
flexibility when it comes co-locating different tiers of the ENUM hierarchy onto ENUM 
servers. Figure 11a gives some examples of possible co-location of the logical Tiers onto 
physical ENUM servers. 

 

Figure 12: Examples of co-location of the ENUM Logical Tiers to ENUM servers 


Figure 11a provides only a set of examples on how the logical Tiers can be mapped onto 
ENUM servers, and does not preclude other configurations such as co-locating both Tier 1 
and Tier 2 for a country on the Tier 0 server or the possibilities to support further Tiers below 
Tier 2 if needed. The possibility to support several Logical Tiers for different countries on one 
ENUM server is also possible allowing a Service provider with operations in several 
countries to co-locate the logical Tier2 for all or several of those countries on a common 
multi-country Tier 2 ENUM server.

In countries where Service Provider Number Portability is employed, this flexibility of the 
ENUM server and Tier structure allows each individual country to agree on different types of 
arrangements of the ENUM structure suiting the situation and requirements of that specific 
country. 

Therefore, Carrier ENUM on the GRX/IPX builds upon this tiered structure, including the 
flexibility to allow diverse national level, and Service Provider level, implementation 
strategies. The following diagram depicts the overall logical architecture for Carrier ENUM on 
the GRX/IPX. 

Figure 13: Logical architecture for Carrier ENUM on the GRX/IPX 


NOTE 1: Represented in the above figure are logical entities and thus one or more 
instances of those logical entities can be offered by one physical server. 

NOTE 2: The GRX/IPX Root DNS Server delegates the agreed Carrier ENUM on the 
GRX/IPX top level domain name, as detailed in section Error! Reference 
source not found., to the ENUM Root Server. The ENUM Root Server and 
all Private ENUM databases located directly or in-directly below are 


delegated different parts of the E.164 number (which commonly, although 
not always, align to the CC, NDC and SN). 

In practice there are many considerations relating to DNS delegation. Who maintains data 
integrity and has control of particular ENUM databases and E.164 number ranges is a matter 
of concern to Service Providers, especially in countries where numbers are portable 
between mobile and fixed operators and there are potentially a large number of 
organisations involved. In the Ågreal worldÅh the delegation structure may not follow the model 
shown above and different Tiers may share the same server and delegation model. 

Commercial arrangements for DNS/ENUM delegation, control and administration; are not 
described in this document. The scope is restricted to describing only technical details. 

5.3.3 Resolution procedure 

A given E.164 number is converted to a FQDN using the procedure described in IETF RFC 
3761 [3]. The resultant FQDN used in Carrier ENUM on the GRX/IPX slightly differs from 
that defined in IETF RFC 3761 [3] though, and is defined below in section Error! Reference 
source not found.. 

GRX/IPX Carrier ENUM utilises the GRX/IPX DNS structure, as defined in section Error! 
Reference source not found.. Therefore, a Slave GRX/IPX Root DNS Server is queried 
first, then the ENUM Root Server, and then one or more Private ENUM Database servers, 
until a final result is obtained. 

The following depicts an example successful ENUM resolution using Carrier ENUM on the 
GRX/IPX: 


 

Figure 14: Example ENUM resolution for an IMS session establishment 


The numbers in the messages in the above diagram refer to the below: 

1. Originating Service Provider's Local Caching DNS Server sends the DNS query to the 
GRX/IPX Root DNS Server. 
2. GRX/IPX Root DNS Server replies with a referral to the ENUM Root Server. 
3. Originating Service Provider re-sends the DNS query, but to the ENUM Root Server. 
4. ENUM Root Server replies with a referral to the First Level ENUM Delegated Database 
Server. 
5. Originating Service Provider re-sends the DNS query to the First Level ENUM Delegated 
Database Server. 
6. First Level ENUM Delegated Database Server replies with either a referral to a Second 
Level ENUM Delegated Database Server, or a final result. 
7. If a referral was received, then Originating Service Provider re-sends the DNS query to 
the Second Level ENUM Delegated Database Server. 
8. Second Level ENUM Delegated Database Server replies with a final result. 


NOTE 1: As per normal DNS procedures, each reply a Service Provider receives is 
cached for a certain amount of time allowing some later queries to be 


answered from the cache instead of always querying other DNS/ENUM 
servers. 

NOTE 2: The Originating Service Provider may apply an optional policy check upon 
receiving any response. 

It is recommended that no more than two ENUM Delegated Databases (that is First Level 
and Second Level) be provisioned in a resolution "chain" for an E.164 number. However, an 
originating Service Provider for ENUM queries needs to be able to query more than this that 
is at least as many queries as there are labels in the ENUM FQDN (see section Error! 
Reference source not found.). 

5.3.4 Access to ENUM servers and Interconnection policy 

Service Providers connected to the GRX/IPX network will be able to perform an ENUM 
Query and obtain a result dependant on the policy established for data accessibility. That is, 
either the querying Service Provider has access to all ENUM servers, or, an error is returned 
(see section Error! Reference source not found. for more details on responses). 

In some instances, it is possible to resolve an E.164 number to a URI, even though there is 
no interconnection agreement (commercial or technical) with the target Service Provider for 
the identified service. This may happen to an originating Service Provider in a number of 
cases, including (but not necessarily limited to) the following: 

. Where access to the ENUM Tier-2 is available due to interconnection agreement with 
the destination Service Provider, but for a different service for example Push to Talk 
over Cellular (PoC) agreement in place but no agreement for Voice/Video Share 
(both services are based on IMS and hence use the same URI scheme). 
. Using a localised ENUM architecture, such as that detailed in Annex B. 
. Automatic derivation of the URI from the E.164 number for example 
MAP_SRI_For_SM look-up (also known as an "IMSI look-up"), back-end connection 
to a number range database (for example MNP database), static look-up table of 
E.164 number block data assignment. For examples of architectures, see Error! 
Reference source not found.. 


In such a case, extra analysis needs to be performed by the Originating Service Provider on 
the derived URI to check local policies on interconnection with regards to the Destination 
Operator and the service being requested by the subscriber. Such a policy should also 
dictate which interconnect address or third-party interconnect provider should be used in 
routing the service. 

For example, policy checking could take place in the service node (for example. MMSC, 
S-CSCF, AS), or, it can take place in the local DNS caching server that is taking care of the 
ENUM resolution. In both cases, there are commercially available solutions. 

5.3.5 Number Portability considerations 

Number Portability implementations differ from country to country, based on national 
requirements and organisation of NDCs, thus there is no single solution that suits all 


countries. Therefore, the ENUM architecture implemented by Service Providers who are part 
of a NP "group", need to provide a common approach between them. 

Different implementation options for support of Number Portability can be identified, where 
some rely on the involvement of the Tier-1 as: 

. Combined Tier-1 and Tier-2 ENUM database, at least per NP "group" 
. Intelligent Tier-1 ENUM database that always redirects the querying entity to the 
currently serving Service Provider 


Other implementation options do not rely on the involvement of the Tier-1 and are managed 
solely based on the service provider Tier-2 include 

. Redirection from Tier-2 of number range owning Service Provider to the Tier-2 of the 
currently serving Service Provider 
. Final response from the Tier-2 of the number range owning Service Provider on behalf of 
the Tier-2 of the currently serving Service Provider 


The Number Portability resolution may be based on Information that is natively stored on the 
ENUM server, or the Tier-1 or Tier-2 servers may interact in real-time with legacy systems 
for Number portability to derive information about the currently serving Service Provider, and 
provide responses based on this information. 

Another aspect of number portability that needs to be considered is when the Tier-1 redirects 
queries to the Tier-2 of the number range owning Service Provider, which shall provide 
responses to cater for ported numbers. In case not all Service Providers within an ÅgNP 
groupÅh participates in the GRX/IPX Carrier ENUM, there is no ÅgnaturalÅh Tier 2 server that 
would be the first to query and which would cater for numbers that are ported out from that 
Service provider. 

See Error! Reference source not found. for more information on how to account for 
Number Portability in ENUM. 

5.4 Technical Requirements 

5.4.1 Introduction 

The implementation of Carrier ENUM on the GRX/IPX is currently in the process of being 
rolled out. The following sections specify the agreed implementation details for ENUM on the 
GRX/IPX network so that it is fully interoperable between all network entities. 

5.4.2 ENUM Query 

Carrier ENUM on the GRX/IPX reuses the ENUM Query procedures and format as 
described in IETF RFC 3761 [3], with the exception that the top level domain name 
"e164enum.net" shall be used instead of "e164.arpa". For example, for the E.164 number 
447700900123, the translated ENUM FQDN to be resolved would be 
3.2.1.0.0.9.0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. Therefore, all ENUM Servers that are part of the 
Carrier ENUM for GRX/IPX shall support ENUM queries to this ENUM FQDN. 


NOTE: In addition to "e164enum.net", other top level domains may also be 
supported (for example in accordance with local in-country ENUM 
requirements), however they must follow "e164enum.net" service 
requirements. Only "e164enum.net" is mandatorily required for Carrier 
ENUM on the GRX/IPX. 

The top level domain name "e164enum.net" has been chosen for Carrier ENUM on the 
GRX/IPX for the following reasons: 

. To ensure there is no conflict with Public ENUM. 
. It is registered on the Internet to GSMA 
. Neutral to service provider technology i.e. neutral between mobile/fixed Service 
Providers and IPX Providers 
. Has an indication of its purpose that is E.164 and ENUM 
. The Åg.netÅh suffix was felt to be relevant to the use of this domain. From IETF RFC 1032 
[25]: 


".net" was introduced as a parent domain for various network-type organizations. 
Organizations that belong within this top-level domain are generic or network-specific, 
such as network service centres and consortia. ".net" also encompasses network 
management-related organizations, such as information centres and operations centres. 

5.4.3 ENUM Response 

5.4.3.1 General 

All ENUM queries to the mandatory FQDN for Carrier ENUM on the GRX/IPX as defined in 
section Error! Reference source not found. shall return a result that is they should never 
be silently discarded by an ENUM server or firewall and so on (for example due to access 
control lists). The result returned can be a pointer to another ENUM Server, a final result 
(that is list of URIs/URLs) or a standard DNS/ICMP error. 

In order to avoid querying entities having to support multiple NP solutions, terminating 
Service Providers in countries that use Number Portability need to provide NP corrected 
data in their final results. Such NP corrected final results should avoid relying upon the 
querying entity supporting any nationally required NP solutions local to the terminating 
Service Provider. 

The NS RR (as defined in IETF RFC 1034 [1]) shall be used to provide a pointer to the next 
ENUM Server to query. 

The NAPTR RR (as defined in IETF RFC 3403 [6] and IETF RFC 3761 [3]) shall be used to 
return a successful final response that is list of URIs/URLs for different service. The following 
sections provide recommendations on how to populate the fields of the NAPTR RR. 

5.4.3.2 URI formats 

The domain name part of URIs returned in NAPTRs shall be in the format detailed in section 
Error! Reference source not found. of the present document, to enable routing through the 
GRX/IPX network using the current GRX/IPX DNS. 


5.4.3.2.1 SIP/IMS URI format 

The SIP/IMS URI format is: 

sip:+<E.164_number>@<xxx>.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone 

 
where "<xxx>" can be any characters or null (if null, then the trailing "." shall not be present), 
and <MNC>/<MCC> are the MNC/MCC allocated to the Service Provider. Other domain 
names that are routable on the inter-Service Provider IP network may also be used. 

Ågsip:Åh indicates the protocol to be used which in this case is SIP. 

With regard to the Åg<xxx>Åh prefix there was no consensus on using any specific value of 
"<xxx>". However, in order to avoid conflicts with sub-domains allocated already (see 
section Error! Reference source not found.) and any possible new sub-domains for new 
services, the sub-domain of ".ims" is recommended. 

The SIP URI parameter Åguser=phoneÅh is included to explicitly indicate that the user part 
contains an E.164 number and is recommended in all cases. For operators that provision 
the SIP URI NAPTR RR only for IMS subscribers, the SIP URI parameter Åguser=phoneÅh 
could be excluded as long as the same SIP URI is also provisioned in their HSS. For 
operators that provision the SIP URI NAPTR RR for both IMS and non-IMS subscribers, they 
should always include the SIP URI parameter Åguser=phoneÅh in the SIP URI of the NAPTR 
RR. 

The following examples are all acceptable NAPTR RR SIP URIs for IMS where the E.164 
number is 447700900123, the MNC is 01 and the MCC is 234: 

sip:+447700900123@mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org 

sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org 

sip:+447700900123@imsnetwork.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org 

sip:+447700900123@mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone 

sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone 

sip:+447700900123@imsnetwork.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone 

 

For Service Providers who offer IMS based services it is recommended that, where possible, 
all of that Service Provider's subscribers should be provisioned with a SIP URI. However, 
Service Providers should be warned that if a subscriber who does not have an HSS entry is 
provisioned with a NAPTR RR containing a SIP URI without the SIP URI parameter 
Åguser=phoneÅh, this may result in SIP sessions/calls failing indefinitely (as the I-CSCF 
handling the incoming session, after not finding any corresponding user in HSS, may not be 
able request routeing based on the E.164 number contained in the SIP URI, due to the 
absence of Åguser=phoneÅh). This is in contrast to when no SIP URI NAPTR RR is provisioned 
for the user and the session/call being alternatively delivered via the PSTN by the originating 
Service Provider. 

It is recommended that a Service Provider should always include the SIP URI parameter 
Åguser=phoneÅh in the SIP URI NAPTR RR and configure and set the I-CSCF to support the 
Åglocal configuration optionÅh to attempt request routeing using the E.164 number derived from 
the SIP URI as is described in Section 5.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [35] when the I-CSCF 


receives the response to the location query from the HSS indicating that the user does not 
exist. 

5.4.3.2.2 SIP-I/Packet Voice Interconnect URI format 

The same recommendations as in section Error! Reference source not found. apply here, 
with the exception that the sub domain labelled Åg<xxx>" is recommended to be "sip-i" or be 
absent/null. This is recommended in order to avoid conflicts with reserved sub-domains (see 
section Error! Reference source not found.) and any possible new sub-domains for new 
services. 

5.4.3.2.3 MMS URI format 

The MMS ENUM URI domain format is the following: 

mailto:+<E.164_number>/TYPE=PLMN@mms.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.gprs 

where <MNC>/<MCC> are the MNC/MCC allocated to the Service Provider. 

The Ågmailto:Åh prefix indicates the protocol to be used which in this case is SMTP. It should be 
noted that this prefix used to be "mms:", however, use of this prefix is now deprecated and 
should no longer be used. For more information see 3GPP TS 23.140 [15]. 

The following example is an acceptable mailto URIs for MMS where the E.164 number is 
447700900123, the MNC is 01 and the MCC is 234: 

mailto:+447700900123/TYPE=PLMN@mms.mnc001.mcc234.gprs 

 
For Service Providers who offer MMS it is recommended that, where possible, all of that 
Service Provider's subscribers should be provisioned with an MMS URI. This allows for all 
MMS interconnecting Service Providers to utilise ENUM instead of MAP in order to 
determine the destination Service Provider and thereby reduce load on that Service 
Provider's HLR. 

5.4.3.3 ENUMservice field 

5.4.3.3.1 Introduction 

The ENUMservice field appears in the NAPTR records for a particular E.164 number. It 
describes the services supported by that number. See section Error! Reference source not 
found. for an example. The following are recommended values to be used for different 
services. 

5.4.3.3.2 SIP/IMS 

The ENUMservice to be used for IMS is ÅgE2U+SIPÅh as specified in IETF RFC 3764 [33]. 

5.4.3.3.3 SIP-I/Packet Voice Interconnect 

The ENUMservice to be used for SIP-I/Packet Voice Interconnect is "E2U+PSTN:SIP" as 
specified in IETF RFC 4769 [43]. 


5.4.3.3.4 MMS 

The ENUMservice to be used for MMS is ÅgE2U+MMS:mailtoÅh as specified in IETF RFC 4355 
[34]. 

It should be noted that this ENUMservice used to be "mms+E2U". However, use of this 
ENUMservice field value is now deprecated and should no longer be used. For more 
information see 3GPP TS 23.140 [15]. 

5.4.3.3.5 Other services 

The value for the ENUMservice field to be used for any other service that uses the GSMA 
Carrier ENUM service should seek to reuse those values that have been reserved with IANA 
as detailed in the List of ENUMservice Registrations [32]. Private/non standardised 
ENUMservice field values should be avoided and instead, registration with IANA should be 
sought (as per the IANA registration process defined in IETF RFC 3761 [3]). 

5.4.3.4 Example NAPTR RR 

The following shows an example of the E.164 number +447700900123 that supports 
SIP/IMS, SIP-I/Packet Voice Interworking and MMS, in a Service Provider's network with 
E.212 number range of MNC 01 and MCC 234 allocated to it. Note that the $ORIGIN 
statement is used here to ensure correct syntax and would have limited use in a large scale, 
live DNS. 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

 NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+PSTN:SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@sip-i.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org!" . 

 NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+MMS:mailto" 

 "!^.*$!mailto:+447700900123/TYPE=PLMN@mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org!" . 

The querying application asks the DNS for all the NAPTR records for a given E.164 number. 
There may be multiple NAPTR records returned as in this example. The querying application 
then selects the NAPTR record(s) that contains the desired service(s), and discards the rest. 

The "u" flag indicates the result of this lookup is a URI. The last part of the NAPTR is a 
Regular Expression and the querying application applies the Regular Expression to the 
query string (that is the E.164 number) to get the result.. In the example above the pattern of 
Åg^.*$Åh instructs the application to match all and any text from the start to the end of the query 
string (that is the E.164 number) and replace it with the following string delimited by the 
following two Åg!Åh, which contains a complete URI/URL. 

As an alternative to including a complete URI/URL, many DNS/ENUM servers make use the 
input regular expression operator ("\1"). This instructs the querying application to insert the 
query string (that is the E.164 number used for the query) wherever it appears. This saves 
repeating of the E.164 number itself in the URI/URL. 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:\\1@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

 NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+PSTN:SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:\\1@sip-i.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org!" . 

 NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+MMS:mailto" 

 "!^.*$!mailto:\\1/TYPE=PLMN@mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org!" . 


 

Here the pattern Åg^.*$Åh once again instructs the application to match all and any text from the 
start to the end of the query string (that is the E.164 number) and replace it with the following 
string delimited by the following two Åg!Åh, which now contains Åg\\1Åh (there are two "\" here to 
prevent the operator being applied too early) instructing the querying application to insert the 
query string (that is the E.164 number). The resulting URIs/URLs returned by these regular 
expressions evaluate to the same as in the first example. 

6 Processes and Procedures relating to DNS 

6.1 Introduction 

This section describes the processes and procedures relating to DNS that apply to Service 
Providers and GRX/IPX Providers. 

6.2 Existing domains/sub-domains on the GRX/IPX network and their 
Allocation 

The domain names for use by Service Providers on the GRX/IPX network are the following: 

. .gprs 
. .3gppnetwork.org 
. .ipxsp.org 
. .e164enum.net 


Only the sub-domains listed in section Error! Reference source not found. for each of the 
above domains should be used. 

The domain name ".e164enum.net" is used only for Carrier ENUM on the GRX/IPX; see 
section Error! Reference source not found. for more information. 

The domain names for use by GRX/IPX Providers on the GRX/IPX are the same as those 
above, when a GRX/IPX Provider is hosting services on behalf of a Service Provider. For all 
other services and also for GRX/IPX network equipment (for example routers, MMS Hubs, 
etc.), it is recommended to use ipxnetwork.org, see section 2.3.3. The ".grx" domain name 
also is commonly used, but should be reserved for legacy equipment on the GRX network. 
The sub-domains on Åg.grxÅh and Ågipxnetwork.orgÅh are agreed amongst other GRX/IPX 
Providers and assigned on a first come . first served basis in order to guarantee uniqueness 
(a good place to discuss this with other GRX/IPX Providers is the GRX Working Party). 

6.3 Procedures relating to new domain names on the GRX/IPX network 

New domain names may be added to the GRX/IPX network's DNS by any Service Provider 
or GRX/IPX Provider, in order to enable further services to be used on the NNI provided by 
the GRX/IPX network. This could be to allow such things as resolution of domain names 
used for national interconnect agreements, and so on. However, wherever possible, the 
existing sub-domains of the domain names specified in section Error! Reference source 
not found. should be reused. 


It is recommended that new domain names to be added to the GRX/IPX network's DNS are: 

. a sub-domain of a Country Code Top Level Domain (ccTLD); 
. registered/reserved on the Internet, in order to prevent any issues of ownership; 
. not provisioned on the Internet (that is. not resolvable, at least no more than is absolutely 
necessary for example to retain ownership as per the rules of some ccTLD authorities); 
. hosted in their own authoritative DNS server(s) on the GRX/IPX network, which is linked 
from the GRX/IPX Root DNS that is by using NS record entries (this eases 
administration of the new domain name and also prevents the GRX/IPX Root DNS 
becoming unmanageable); and 
. used by an entity in addition to either their "mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org" 
domain name or "spn<SPN>.ipxsp.org" domain name, as specified in section Error! 
Reference source not found. (amongst other things, this enables network node naming 
as per section Error! Reference source not found.). 


The hosting authoritative DNS server(s) need to be reachable and respond to queries from 
all Service Providers and/or GRX/IPX Providers that need to resolve associated FQDNs. 
Ideally, access should be allowed to all entities on the GRX/IPX network, but only those who 
need to should have their queries properly serviced; the rest should be returned a standard 
DNS or ICMP error. 

Care should be taken to not inadvertently force another entity who is denied 
access/resolvability of the domain name into (automatically or otherwise) trying to resolve it, 
including (but not necessarily limited to): 

. by using only the new domain name in general network node naming (network node 
naming should still be done as per section Error! Reference source not found., using 
the domain names recommended therein); and 
. by returning it in a NAPTR and/or SRV record (for example as used in IMS/SIP, ENUM, 
EPC). 


For domain names that need to be resolvable on the UNI, the Internet DNS should always 
be used. By design, the GRX/IPX DNS provides resolution only for entities connected to the 
NNI. 

6.4 Description of the Master Root DNS service and modality of access 

6.4.1 Master Root DNS services 

The Master Root DNS provides authoritative naming management and address resolution 
mechanisms for the GSMA community that includes GRX Providers, IPX Providers and 
Mobile Network Operators. This translates into two main functions: 

. Assignment and administration of domain names according to IR67 specification 
. DNS zone transfer and query resolution services 


The Root DNS is currently available at three peering locations (Amsterdam in the 
Netherland, Singapore and Ashburn in the United States). Additional locations can be added 
as necessary. 


6.4.2 How to access Master Root DNS services 

For an entity (GRX/IPX Provider or Mobile Network Operator) to connect to the Root DNS 
and access its services it is required to first register and become a ÅgparticipantÅh. The 
registration involves a light accreditation process to verify the identity the entities connecting 
to system and the intended use of the services. 

The accreditation process is simple and usually requires five working days. As part of the 
accreditation process the entity is required to fill in a form called the Ågparticipating 
agreementÅh. The participating agreements contains the terms and conditions for the use of 
the service and some basic information of the applying entity such company name, technical 
and administrative contract, GRX/IPX peering points. 

Once it has been completed the form is sent to the Master Root DNS operator (Neustar) that 
is responsible to check and verify the information provided using appropriate sources 
including the IR21 database. If the verification is passed a contract is sent to the applying 
entity to be signed. If information is missing or incorrect the applying entity is required to 
resubmit the participating agreement. 

If an application request is either controversial or unsuccessful, it is escalated to GSMA staff 
for their consideration and their final decision. The applying entity can appeal against a 
rejection by contacting the GRX/IPX chair. 

Once the accreditation process has been completed and the contract has been signed, the 
Root DNS customer is activated. As part of the activation process a customer account is 
created in the system and a secureID Token is send to the ÅgparticipantÅh with password 
activation to allow the customer access the system through a secure web portal interface 
over the Internet. The peering between the customer and the Root DNS is established and 
tested. As final step of the activation process the customerÅfs name servers are provisioned 
in the Master Root DNS system. 

Once the activation process is completed the customer can start provisioning information in 
the Root DNS through the web portal. The customer then can create, delete, modify and 
transfer domain names on behalf of Mobile Operators and its other customers according to 
the rules defined in IR67. 

For any administrative, technical and operation issue regarding the service, including the 
form required for the accreditation process, please contact gsma_root_dns@gsma.com. 

6.5 Delegation of sub-domains of Ågpub.3gppnetwork.orgÅh 

GSMA can delegate a sub-domain of pub.3gppnetwork.org to DNS of an MNO. The routine 
specified by GSMA operations, that the MNO needs follow to do this, consists of the 
following steps: 

1. Identify MCC and MNC values for the MNO. 
2. Identify CNAME record for the domain to be transferred. 


The CNAME record shall be in format of: 
<ABC>.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.pub.3gppnetwork.org 


where 

acceptable values of <ABC> are defined in 2.3.4 (other values might be added as 
needed; see also NOTE 2 below) 

<MNC> and <MCC> have to be replaced by respective values of the home network in 
decimal format, with a 2-digit MNC padded out to 3 digits by inserting a 0 at the 
beginning. 

NOTE 1: For RCS configuration server CNAME record should be in format of 
http://config.rcs.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.pub.3gppnetwork.org 

NOTE 2: An operator may wish to delegate the entire 
mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.pub.3gppnetwork.org sub-domain. 

3. Create the Zone File on the MNOÅfs own NameServer/DNS with the CNAME record 
specified in step 2. 
4. Complete the Request Form in Annex D.1 and - if required for your use of the sub-
domain - also the Letter of Authorization in Appendix D.2, and send both to GSMA 
at 3gppnetwork.org_delegation@gsma.com 


 

NOTE 3: the Letter of Authorization format (Annex D.2) may need to be adapted 
dependent on your selected Certificate BodyÅfs requirements. If in doubt, 
please contact a Certificate Body of your choice, and obtain a necessary

Annex A Sample BIND DNS Configuration for GPRS 

A.1 Introduction 

All sample configurations of this annex are in valid syntactical format for the ISC BIND DNS 
server software. However, the samples are not from actual DNS configuration and contain 
only example information, including sample IP addresses which are not valid. They are 
provided for illustration purposes only. It is therefore highly recommended NOT to use these 
samples in live networks! The GSM Association takes no responsibility of the usage of these 
configurations in any operators DNS servers and/or live networks. 

A.2 The "named.conf" file 

The "named.conf" file has configuration information for BIND software. Following is only the 
necessary configuration to get DNS running. There are many more options that may also be 
useful, but which are not shown here, simply for making the examples as simple as possible. 

A.2.1 The "named.conf" file for a PLMN Master Nameserver 

options { 
directory "/var/named"; 
}; // where the files reside 

zone "." in { 
type hint; 
file "gprs.hint"; 
}; // gprs root servers 

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" in { 
type master; 
notify no; 
file "master/0.0.127.in-addr.arpa"; 
}; // only contains information about localhost. 

/*

*/ 

zone "mnc091.mcc244.gprs" in { 
type master; 
file "master/mnc091.mcc244.gprs"; 
}; 

zone "sonera.fi.gprs" in { 
type master; 
file "master/sonera.fi.gprs"; 
}; // human readable operator id 

zone "168.192.in-addr.arpa" in { 
type master; 
file "master/168.192.in-addr.arpa"; 
}; 


A.2.2 The "named.conf" file for a PLMN Slave Nameserver 

options { 
directory "/var/named"; 
}; // where the files reside 

zone "." in { 
type hint; 
file "gprs.hint"; 
}; // gprs root servers 

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" in { 
type master; 
notify no; 
file "master/0.0.127.in-addr.arpa"; 

}; // only contains information about localhost. 

/* 
* PLMN domain information 
*/ 

zone "mnc091.mcc244.gprs" in { 
type slave; 
file "slave/mnc091.mcc244.gprs"; 
masters {192.168.1.2;} // address of master nameserver 
}; 

zone "sonera.fi.gprs" in { 
type master; 
file "slave/sonera.fi.gprs"; 
masters {192.168.1.2;} // address of master nameserver 
}; // human readable operator id; 

zone "168.192.in-addr.arpa" in { 
type slave; 
file "slave/168.192.in-addr.arpa"; 
masters {192.168.1.2;} // address of master nameserver 
}; 

A.3 Zone Configuration Files 

Recommended values for SOA records are as specified in ripe-203. 

A.3.1 The "gprs.hint" file 

This file contains ".gprs" root nameservers needed to initialise cache of ".gprs" nameservers. 
Note that the Åg.Åh character is indeed significant.

A.3.3 PLMN zone files 

PLMN may configure both mnc.mcc.gprs and operaror.cc.gprs type domains that will share 
exactly the same host information. In addition, early versions of GTPv0 did not have leading 
zeroes to make mnc code always 3 digits long. In order to minimise both configuration work 
and possible errors, zone files may include a common host configuration. 

A.3.3.1 The "mnc091.mcc244.gprs" file

A.3.4 The "hosts" file 

This file contains IP address records for all hosts in the PLMN. The origin changes 
depending on which file includes the contents i.e. after the names not ending at dot, the 
current domain name is appended automatically. 

Load balancing may be performed configuring same access point with several IP addresses 
that actually are on different GGSNs. In this case, addresses are used in round-robin 


fashion. However, DNS information is cached and a new query is performed only when the 
TTL (time-to-live) has expired. Therefore TTL of 0 seconds is configured for load balanced 
access points.

Annex B Alternative ENUM Architecture: Multiple Root Model 

B.1 Introduction 

This Annex describes an alternative to the preferred ENUM architecture model described in 
section Error! Reference source not found.. As per the preferred ENUM architecture 
model, the following model utilises the technical requirements as detailed in section Error! 
Reference source not found., allowing full interoperability between Service Provider and 
different ENUM Service Providers (ESPs). 

In this architecture model, a common root DNS server is not utilised. Instead, the root node 
functionality along with the ENUM Tier 0 and possibly also the Tier 1 are provisioned by an 
authoritative database either within the operator's network or outside the operator's network 
via a service bureau. In essence, this means that connection to the GRX/IPX Carrier ENUM 
is not a requirement, although, the GRX/IPX may be used to interconnect the end user 
service. It also means that an operator implementing this option does not necessarily have to 
wait for roll out of an ENUM Tier 1 server for the destination operator. 

Operators who implement this option need to also apply a policy to the derived URI, as 
discussed in section Error! Reference source not found., to avoid late session-
establishment-failure or even worse, session-connection-timeout for their subscribers. 

B.2 Architecture 

The architecture for this model has many Authoritative Database provisioning options. This 
means that Service Providers have flexibility and may choose how to provision their ENUM 
databases depending on their network and market or regulatory environment. This has an 
advantage in that it allows Service Providers to choose the best option for their environment, 
based on such factors as local numbering policy, number portability solution, etc. 

What remains the same though is that the Tier-2 server for the destination operator is 
identified. 


The architecture for this model is depicted in the following figure: 

 

Figure 15: Architecture for the Multiple Root Model 


It is an implementation option as to when a Service Provider provisions their own ENUM 
Server or utilises an ENUM Server in an ESP for destination numbers. 


ENUM requests to an external network (e.g. GRX/IPX) and consequently to an authoritative 
DNS server in Service Provider B, is optional and occurs only when the ENUM Server does 
not return a final answer. 

The ESP Determination DNS Server is used by the Service Provider to utilise multiple 
ENUM Servers (residing in their own network and/or in one or more ESPs) or, one or more 
ENUM Servers and the Single Root architecture model (further specification on interworking 
between the two architectural models is FFS in a future version of the present document). 
The Local Caching DNS Server needs to be preconfigured to forward DNS requests for 
domains ending in "e164enum.net" to the ESP Determination DNS Server. Alternatively, the 
two nodes/features can be provisioned on the same platform. 

As shown above, there are three different implementation models that leverage existing 
industry sources of number-assignment data: 

. Number portability database: ENUM server or ESP utilizes an existing authoritative 
number portability database to determine the destination carrier for a given dialled 
number. The operator originating the query uses local policy information to provision an 
appropriate entry-point address for each of its interconnect partners as shown below. 
. Number-block database: ENUM server or ESP utilizes an existing authoritative 
number-block assignment database to determine the destination carrier for a given 
dialled number. This model works in any country that does not support number-
portability. 
. MAP SRI for SM query: ENUM server or ESP utilizes existing HLR databases to 
discover the destination carrier for GSM networks around the world. 


B.3 Resolution 

The address resolution process in this model breaks down into the following logical steps: 

Identify the ESP to use (given the dialled number); 

. Identify the Subscribed Network (using the determined ESP). 


Local policy should be applied either at the ESP or in the Service Provider network, as 
detailed in section Error! Reference source not found.. 

The following figure depicts an example ENUM resolution for this model, after the Core 
Routing Platform has sent the necessary ENUM query to its local caching DNS server:

DNS ServerDestination Service Provider(subscribed network)
ENUM DNS 
ServerENUM DNS 
Server13245a5bESP Determination 
DNS Server 


Figure 16: Example ENUM resolution in the Multiple Root Model 


The numbers in the messages in the above figure refer to the below: 

1. Service Provider's Local Caching DNS Server sends the DNS query to its own ESP 
Determination DNS Server (which is essentially a DNS server that is authoritative for 
"e164enum.net"). 
2. ESP Determination DNS Server analyses the queried ENUM FQDN. It then replies with 
the NS record for the Service Provider's chosen ESP for that domain (based on 
pre-configuration). 
3. Service Provider re-sends the DNS query, but to the Special ENUM DNS Server in the 
ESP. 
4. The ESP looks-up the E.164 number by using connections to existing ENUM servers, 
referencing number block data, querying (M)NP databases and/or by issuing a 
MAP_SRI_For_SM to the target network's HLR. It then replies with a list of URIs/URLs 
associated with the given E.164 number in NAPTR records, or the NS record(s) of the 
subscribed network's authoritative DNS server. 
5. If the ESP replied with (an) NS record(s), then: 
. a) The Service Provider re-sends the query, but to the subscribed network's 
authoritative DNS server. 
. b) The subscribed network replies with a list of URIs/URLs associated with the 
given E.164 number in NAPTR records. 






NOTE: As per normal DNS procedures, each reply a Service Provider receives is 
cached for a certain amount of time, therefore, negating the need of every 
message shown always having to be sent. 


B.4 Access to ENUM Servers 

In this model, the ENUM Service Provider takes care of all commercial agreements and any 
charges incurred for access to the sources of its back-end data used to service queries from 
Service Providers. The Service Provider typically will have a commercial agreement with an 
ENUM Service Provider (of which may include charges). Access to Service Provider Tier-2 
servers is still required though. 

B.5 Interworking with the preferred model 

Service Providers who utilise this model still have to provide ENUM DNS Tier-1 and Tier-2 
servers to enable other Service Providers utilising the preferred model (as described in 
sub-clause 5.3) to be able to resolve their queries. Such provisioning is implementation 
dependent, and no recommendations are made in the present document. 


Annex C Solving Number Portability in ENUM 

C.1 Introduction 

This section describes and analyses different approaches for provisioning ENUM in 
countries where Number Portability exists. The approach used will depend on the Number 
Portability solution used in the local county for the hosted number ranges. 

The different approaches can be categorized based on at which Tier the knowledge about 
ported users is available. At a centralized Tier-1 ENUM DNS server or decentralized at the 
Tier-2 ENUM DNS servers 

C.2 Options based on number portability knowledge at a central ENUM 
server 

C.2.1 Option 1 . Central authoritative database 

C.2.1.1 Description 

This option consists of combining the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ENUM tiers and having the country 
level ENUM DNS server authoritative for all subscribers. This means that all URIs and/or 
URLs for subscribers are centrally located and managed.

number

Figure 17: Central Authoritative database 


 


C.2.1.2 Example Configuration 

If the subscriber whose E.164 number is +44-7700-900123 is a subscriber of Service 
Provider 1 in the UK, his SIP URI (for IMS) could be 
"SIP:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone" and would be 
provisioned in his ENUM record in the central database as follows: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 


If this subscriber then moved/ported over to Service Provider 2 in the UK, then this SIP URI 
in the central database would simply be modified to be 
"SIP:+447700900123@ims.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone" thus: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

C.2.1.3 Advantages and Disadvantages 

The obvious disadvantage of this option is that the data-fill for such a combined Tier-1/2 
could be very large! The widely used, freely available ISC BIND DNS server application 
would more than likely not be able to cope with such a data-fill for this solution. However, 
there are high capacity ENUM/DNS solutions commercially available. 

This option does have the advantage though that all subscriber numbers are stored centrally 
and so can be centrally controlled and administered, possibly by one O&M facility. It also has 
the advantage in that it reduces the number of DNS requests that an ENUM/DNS resolver 
has to perform by one DNS Request therefore the extra time taken to search through a 
larger set of zone files to return the NAPTR records may in some circumstances actually be 
quicker than the DNS resolver having to perform a further DNS look-up to a separate Tier-2. 

C.2.1.4 Suitability 

This option is possibly more suited to countries having a central ENUM Tier 1 server and 
where their MNPs are already realised using a central (M)NP database. 

C.2.2 Option 2 . Central redirection database 

C.2.2.1 Description 

This option consists of combining the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ENUM tiers but instead of having the 
country level ENUM DNS server store the URIs and/or URLs for subscribers, each 
subscriber record contains a special redirection indicator for all incoming look-ups. The 
indicator provides a pointer to the subscribed network. This "capture all" redirection can be 
realised using a single NS record. This NS record redirects the ENUM/DNS Resolver to the 
newly subscribed network's ENUM/DNS server by returning a new DNS server to query. 
This means that all URIs and/or URLs for subscribers are located and managed by the 
actual subscribed network of each number, rather than the number range owning network of 
each number.

Figure 18: Central redirection database 


C.2.2.2 Example 

If the subscriber whose E.164 number is +44-7700-900123, and is also a subscriber of 
Service Provider 1 in the UK, his record in the Central Database would be as follows: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 IN NS dns1.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org 

 
And would be reflected in Service Provider 1's DNS server (called 
"dns1.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org") as follows: 

$ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.0.9.0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

 
If this subscriber then moved over to Service Provider 2 in the UK, then the ENUM record 
stored in the Central Database would be modified to the following: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 IN NS dns1.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org 

 
And hence, Service Provider 2's DNS server (called 
"dns1.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org") would be: 

$ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.0.9.0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

 


C.2.2.3 Advantages and Disadvantages 

The main advantage of this option is that it puts the subscribed operator in full control of the 
URIs/URLs returned for a particular Tel URI. An explicit advantage over option 3 is that the 
newly subscribed network is not reliant upon the number range owning network to make any 
updates in their ENUM DNS server, only the Tier-1. 

An explicit disadvantage over option 1 though is that the DNS Resolver may have to perform 
either one additional ENUM DNS look-up to the Tier-2 ENUM DNS server. 

As for option 1, the obvious disadvantage of this option is that the data-fill for the Tier-1 
could be very large! The widely used, freely available ISC BIND DNS server application 
would more than likely not be able to cope with such a data-fill for this solution. However, 
there are high capacity ENUM/DNS solutions commercially available. 

C.2.2.4 Suitability 

This option is possibly more suited to countries having a central ENUM Tier 1 server and 
where their MNP is already realised using a central MNP database. 

 

C.3 Options based on number portability knowledge at Service Provider Tier-
2 ENUM server 

These options have in common that the Tier-1 ENUM/DNS server redirects to the Tier-2 
ENUM/DNS of the Service Provider originally owning the number range. 

A common disadvantage for these options compared to the centralized server options is 
that, to work properly, all Service Provider within an NP Group should have a Tier-2 ENUM 
DNS server. 

Potential methods and measures to deal with the problem of not all Services Provider having 
an ENUM/DNS server are discussed in section Error! Reference source not found.. 

An advantage with this option over the centralized server approaches is that is does not 
require a per country centralized server. In countries where there are problems to establish 
such a Tier-1 server, the decentralized options 3 to 6 described below can still be applied 
when the Tier-1 functionality to redirect to the number range ownerÅfs ENUM DNS server can 
be hosted on the Tier 0 server. 

 

C.3.1 Option 3 . Change of domain name in URIs/URLs in Tier-2 

C.3.1.1 Description 

This option is similar to the previous one in that it consists of simply changing the domain 
name in all URIs and/or URLs under individual E.164 number entries to the identity of the 
newly subscribed network. However, the Tier-1 and Tier-2 are not combined but kept 
separate.

C.3.1.2 Example 

If the subscriber whose E.164 number is +44-7700-900123 is a subscriber of Service 
Provider 1 in the UK, his SIP URI (for IMS) could be 
"SIP:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org" and would be provisioned in 
his ENUM record in Service Provider 1's Tier-2 DNS server as follows: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org!" . 

If this subscriber then moved/ported over to Service Provider 2 in the UK, then this SIP URI 
would be modified in Service Provider 1's Tier-2 DNS server to be 
"SIP:+447700900123@ims.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org" thus: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org!" . 

 

C.3.1.3 Advantages and Disadvantages 

A disadvantage of this option is that the newly subscribed network is reliant upon the number 
range owning network to not only make the changes at the time of porting, but to also 
support later additions and modifications to URIs and/or URLs; possibly relating to services 
that may not be offered by the number range owning network. For example, if Service

Provider 2 rolled-out an IP based service (that uses ENUM) before Service Provider 1, then 
Service Provider 1 would have to provision in their Tier-2 DNS all the ENUM records for 
those subscribers who have ported to Service Provider 2 with the new URI(s) and/or URL(s). 
Service Provider 1 may also not be able to do this in a time period that is satisfactory to 
Service Provider 2's launch of the new service. 

C.3.1.4 Suitability 

This option is suited to countries where their MNP is not realised using a central MNP 
database. It may also be suitable for countries having no central Tier-1 ENUM server, but 
where the Tier 1 functionality is hosted by the Tier-0. 

C.3.2 Option 4 . Redirection at Tier-2 

C.3.2.1 Description 

This option consists of having a "normal" Tier-1 and Tier-2 however, the number range 
owning network's Tier-2 DNS server storing for each ported-out subscriber, a special 
redirection indicator for all incoming look-ups (effectively creating an extra "Tier-3" for all 
ported out subscribers). The indicator provides a pointer to the subscribed network. This 
"capture all" redirection is realised using a single NS record. This NS record redirects the 
ENUM/DNS Resolver to the newly subscribed network's ENUM/DNS server by returning a 
new DNS server to query. 

 

Figure 20: : Redirection at Tier-2 



C.3.2.2 Example 

If the subscriber whose E.164 number is +44-7700-900123 is a subscriber of Service 
Provider 1 in the UK, his SIP URI (for IMS) could be 
"SIP:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org" and would be reflected in his 
ENUM record as standard, thus: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

 

If this subscriber then moved over to Service Provider 2 in the UK, then the ENUM record 
stored in Service Provider 1's Tier-2 DNS server would be something like the following: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 IN NS dns1.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org 

 

In Service Provider 2's DNS server, called "dns1.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org", would 
be needed something like the following: 

$ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.0.9.0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

 

The DNS resolver will more than likely already "know" the IP address for the DNS server 
"dns1.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org" due to previous look-ups. At the very least, it will 
know the authoritative server for the domain "3gppnetwork.org" from the current set of 
look-ups! This can be controlled further by increasing the said DNS Server's FQDN's TTL 
(which is achievable as today operators change the IP addresses of their DNS servers very 
infrequently). So in the common case, this solution will involve one extra DNS look-up, and 
in the worst case involve two extra DNS look-ups. 

C.3.2.3 Advantages and Disadvantages 

The main advantage of this option is that it puts the subscribed operator in full control of the 
URIs/URLs returned for a particular Tel URI, in the same manner as for option 2. 

A disadvantage of this option is that the newly subscribed network is still reliant upon the 
number range owning network to make updates in their ENUM Tier-2 DNS server. However, 
unlike Option 3, the update is only minor, only has to be done once (or at least, only when 
the subscriber changes/ports networks) and encompasses all services relating to ENUM; 
whether they are supported by the number range owning network or not! 

An explicit disadvantage over option 3 though is that the DNS Resolver may have to perform 
one additional ENUM DNS look-up to resolve ported numbers. 

 


C.3.2.4 Suitability 

As with Option 3, this option is more suited to countries where their MNPs are not realised 
using a central MNP database, and it is also suitable to countries where the Tier-1 
functionality is hosted by the Tier 0. 

 

C.3.3 Option 5 . Redirection at Tier-2 based on interaction with Legacy NP 
systems 

C.3.3.1 Description 

This option consists of having a "normal" Tier-1 and Tier-2. However for numbers where the 
Tier-2 servers do not have a corresponding ENUM record, the Tier-2 Interacts with a legacy 
Number Portability system and based on legacy NP information, it determines the currently 
serving Service Provider, and creates a NS response to redirect to that Service Provider. 
The legacy Number Portability information used to identify the serving Service Provider can 
for example be the IMSI, when available or SS7 routing information used by ISUP. 

That information can be used to point to the appropriate NS record to use.

Figure 21: Redirection at Tier-2 based on Legacy NP system interaction 


 

C.3.3.2 Example 

If the subscriber whose E.164 number is +44-7700-900123 is a subscriber of Service 
Provider 1 in the UK, his SIP URI (for IMS) could be 


"SIP:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org" and would be provisioned in 
his ENUM record in Service Provider 1's Tier-2 DNS server as follows: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

 

If this subscriber then moved over to Service Provider 2 in the UK, then the ENUM record 
stored in Service Provider 1's Tier 2 DNS server would be removed, and when a query for 
this number is received Service Provider 1's Tier-2 DNS server would interact with the 
Legacy NP system using for example an INAP or MAP query. 

The response from the legacy NP system, informs that the number is now supported by 
Service Provider 2, and something like the following would be created. 

$ ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 IN NS dns1.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org 

 

In Service Provider 2's DNS server, called "dns1.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org", would 
be needed something like the following: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org!" . 

 

In Service Provider 2's DNS server, called "dns1.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org", would 
be needed something like the following: 

$ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.0.9.0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

 

C.3.3.3 Advantages and Disadvantages 

A disadvantage with this option is the need for interaction with the legacy NP system. At a 
minimum this interaction can be compared with performing an additional query in recursive 
mode. 

Compared to alternative 4, this option does not require any updates to the number range 
ownerÅfs ENUM/DNS server when a number is ported, more than that the E.164 entry for the 
ported number need to be removed from the Number range owning Service ProviderÅfs Tier 2 
server, and that information about how to translate the legacy number portability information 
to an NS record pointing to the other Service ProviderÅfs ENUM DNS server need to be 
configured. However this need only to be introduced once, and not for every ported number. 

The main advantage of this option is that it puts the subscribed operator in full control of the 
URIs/URLs returned for a particular Tel URI, in the same manner as for option 4. An explicit 
advantage over option 4 is that the newly subscribed network is not reliant upon the number 


range owning network to make any updates in their ENUM DNS server, as the newly 
subscribed network is identified from the Legacy NP system. 

C.3.3.4 Suitability 

This option is possibly more suited in for countries no Tier 1 server and the Tier-1 
functionality is hosted by the Tier-1, and where all Service Providers have access to full 
Number Portability information, 

C.3.4 Option 6 . Non-Authoritative response based on Legacy NP system 
interaction 

C.3.4.1 Description 

This option consists of having a "normal" Tier-1 and Tier-2. However for Numbers where the 
Tier-2 servers do not have a corresponding ENUM record, the Tier-2 may utilize legacy 
Number portability information and based on that information create a non-authoritative final 
response, where for example the legacy Number Portability routing information (for example 
IMSI or routing number, and so on) can be used to create a the domain name to be used in 
for example a SIP URI.

Interactions 


C.3.4.2 Example 

If the subscriber whose E.164 number is +44-7700-900123 is a subscriber of Service 
Provider 1 in the UK, his SIP URI (for IMS) could be 


"SIP:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org" and would be reflected in his 
ENUM record as standard, thus: 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc001.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

 

If this subscriber then moved over to Service Provider 2 in the UK, then the ENUM record 
stored in Service Provider 1's Tier-2 DNS server would be removed, and when a query for 
this number is received Service Provider 1's Tier-2 DNS server would interact with the 
Legacy NP system using for example an INAP or MAP query. 

The response from the legacy NP system, informs that the number is now supported by 
Service Provider 2, and something like the following would be created. 

$ORIGIN 0.0.7.7.4.4.e164enum.net. 

 3.2.1.0.0.9 NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+SIP" 

 "!^.*$!sip:+447700900123@ims.mnc002.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org;user=phone!" . 

 

The NAPTR RR record returned in this case may be considered as Non-authoritative as 
even if it provided based on consent by Service Provider 2, it is created based on legacy 
number portability information. In difference to Option 3, Service Provider 2 does not have 
the possibility to individualize the NAPTR records per E.164 number. 

C.3.4.3 Advantages and Disadvantages 

A disadvantage with this option is the need for interaction with the legacy NP system. At a 
minimum this interaction can be compared with performing an additional query in recursive 
mode. 

Another important disadvantage is that the currently serving Service Provider cannot decide 
for which of his Ported-in numbers he wants a NAPTR Record returned. If the serving 
Service Provider only wants to populate his ENUM DNS server with for numbers having an 
IMS service, this information may not be available in the Legacy NP system, with the result 
the NAPTR records will be returned also for numbers that for example only are served on 
CS. 

C.3.4.4 Suitability 

This option is possibly more suited in for countries where no Tier 1 server and the Tier-1 
functionality is hosted by the Tier-1, and where all Service Providers have access to full 
Number Portability information, 

 


C.3.5 Considerations when not all Servicer provider have a Tier-2 ENUM 
DNS server 

As mentioned, there may be problems with a decentralized Number portability solution if not 
all Service Providers have a Tier-2 ENUM DNS server. 

In case one Service Provider does not have an ENUM/DNS server, there is no Tier-2 
ENUM/DNS server that would hold NAPTR or NS records for the numbers that have been 
ported out to other Service Providers. 

To allow a Service Provider who wants to be able to provide ENUM entries for all served 
E.164 number, including ported-in numbers when a decentralized solution is used, a number 
of methods that may help overcome the problem when not all Serve Providers have a Tier-2, 
as proposed below. 

C.3.5.1 Hosting of Ported-in numbers at the Tier-1 

Although the Options 3, 4, 5 and 6 are decentralized in nature, and the Tier-1 only should 
make redirects to the Number Range Holders, Service Providers make arrangement with the 
Tier-1 (or Tier-0 if it hosts the Tier-1 functionality) ENUM/DNS server to host entries for 
numbers ported in from a Service Provider not having a Tier-2 ENUM/DNS server. 

This alternative can be used for all decentralized options. 

C.3.5.2 Tier-1 redirects to alternative Service Provider Tier-2 server 

For Options 5 and 6 which rely on information from Legacy NP systems, to determine the 
currently serving Service Provider, one or more of the Tier-2 Service Providers could agree 
to access the legacy NP system not only for his own Number ranges nut also for Number 
ranges held by a Service Provider not having an ENUM DNS server. 

The Tier-1 (or Tier-0 for countries where the Tier-1 is hosted by the Tier-0 server) could then 
refer to the Alternative Servicer ProviderÅfs ENUM/DNS server when the number range owner 
does not have a Tier-2. 

If several or all Tier-2 Service Provider agree to do the same to share the cost and load, the 
Tier-1 server, can provide multiple NS records with the same priority, one for each of the 
ÅgparticipatingÅh Tier-2 Service ProviderÅfs ENUM/DNS servers. 

DNS resolvers could then randomize which ÅgparticipatingÅh Tier-2 Service ProviderÅfs DNS 
server they would access to resolve the number.
