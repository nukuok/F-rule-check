The objective of this document is to address the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) consisting of Ici and <strong><font color=red>Izi</font></strong> reference points between IMS networks in order to support end-to-end service interoperability.The present document will address the issues related to control plane signalling (3GPP usage of SIP and <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> protocols, required SIP header fields) as well as other interconnecting aspects like security, numbering/naming/addressing and user plane issues as transport protocol, media and codecs actually covered in a widespread set of 3GPP specifications. A profiling of the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) is also provided.Charging aspects will be addressed as far as SIP signalling is concerned.SIP signalling traversing the NNI between a CSCF and an AS or MRB, e.g. for media control or Voice Interworking with Enterprise IP-PBX, and SIP signalling traversing the NNI on the Mr interface between the CSCF and the MRFC, or on the Mr' interface between the AS and MRFC, or on the Rc interface between AS and MRB is not considered in the present release of this specification.SIP signalling traversing the NNI between an ISC gateway and an AS in an enterprise network, e.g. for media control and voice interworking with enterprise IP-PBX, on the ISC interface between the ISC gateway and the enterprise network is not considered in the present release of this specification.          </td>

Interconnection between two different IM CN subsystems shall be guaranteed in order to support end-to-end service interoperability. For this purpose, Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) between two IM CN subsystem networks is adopted, according to the assumptions coming from 3GPP TS 23.002 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.228 [4].NOTE:	The end-to-end service interoperability within one IM CN subsystem over the Mi, Mm, Mw and <strong><font color=red>I2</font></strong> reference points not passing over the <strong><font color=red>Mx</font></strong> reference point as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [4] is outside the scope of this document.Aiming to support the delivery of IMS services between two separated IM CN subsystems, protocol interconnection has to occur:-	at a control plane level, in order that IMS procedures can be supported. In this case the adopted reference point is the Ici; and-	at a user plane level, where media streams are exchanged over the <strong><font color=red>Izi</font></strong> reference point.IP multimedia sessions are managed by SIP. The transport mechanism for both SIP session signalling and media transport is IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 [2]) or IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460 [7]). The 3GPP profile of SIP defining the usage of SIP within the IM CN subsystem is specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]. Example call flows are provided in 3GPP TR 24.930 [6].The general interconnection model is shown in figure 4.1. Figure 4.1: Interconnection Model for IM CN subsystemsThe II-NNI traversal scenarios in this document are covered in figure 4.2 and figure 4.3. NOTE 1:	Any II-NNI can contain intermediate transit network(s). The intermediate transit network can either be an IMS transit network with or without a transit function as specified in TS 24.229 [5] or a non-IMS transit network using standards outside the scope of 3GPP.NOTE 2:	IMS home network A and IMS home network B represent the IMS home network on originating side and terminating side respectively.NOTE 3:	IMS visited network X and IMS visited network Y represent the IMS visited network on originating side and terminating side respectively.Figure 4.2: II-NNI traversal scenarios when P-CSCF is located in visited network and when home routeing is used NOTE 1:	Any II-NNI can contain intermediate transit network(s).

Figure 5.1.1 illustrates the architecture diagram given in 3GPP TS 23.228 [4] showing the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) between two IM CN subsystem networks. NOTE:	The TRF can reside in a stand-alone entity or can be combined with another functional entity.Figure 5.1.1: Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface between two IM CN subsystem networksThe protocols over the two reference points Ici and <strong><font color=red>Izi</font></strong> make up the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface.The Ici reference point allows IBCFs to communicate with each other in order to provide the communication and forwarding of SIP signalling messaging between IM CN subsystem networks. The <strong><font color=red>Izi</font></strong> reference point allows <strong><font color=red>TrGW</font></strong>s to forward media streams between IM CN subsystem networks.IMS roaming performed by using II-NNI is considered, when the IBCFs are inserted at the network borders. The applicability of roaming scenario by using II-NNI is based on agreement between the operators.Whenever the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface is used to interconnect two IM CN subsystem networks belonging to different security domains, security procedures apply as described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [10].When an IMS transit network is providing application services and interconnecting two IM CN subsystem networks, as described in 3GPP TS 23.228 [4], interfaces on both sides of the IMS transit network are within the scope of this document.          </td>

An IBCF provides application specific functions at the SIP/<strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> protocol layer in order to perform interconnection between IM CN subsystem networks by using Ici reference point. According to 3GPP TS 23.228 [4], IBCF can act both as an entry point and as an exit point for the IM CN subsystem network.The functionalities of IBCF are indicated in the 3GPP TS 23.228 [4] and specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]. They include:-	network topology hiding;-	application level gateway (for instance enabling communication between IPv6 and IPv4 SIP applications, or between a SIP application in a private IP address space and a SIP application outside this address space);-	controlling transport plane functions;-	controlling media plane adaptations;-	screening of SIP signalling information;-	selecting the appropriate signalling interconnect;-	generation of charging data records;-	privacy protection; and-	inclusion of a transit IOI in requests when acting as an entry point for a transit network and in responses when acting as an exit point for a transit network.Based on local configuration, the IBCF performs transit routing functions as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] clause I.2.The IBCF acts as a B2BUA when it performs IMS-ALG functionality.          </td>

According to 3GPP TS 23.002 [3], the <strong><font color=red>TrGW</font></strong> is located at the network borders within the media path and is controlled by an IBCF. Forwarding of media streams between IM CN subsystem networks is applied over <strong><font color=red>Izi</font></strong> reference point.The <strong><font color=red>TrGW</font></strong> provides functions like network address/port translation and IPv4/IPv6 protocol translation. NAT-PT binds addresses in IPv6 network with addresses in IPv4 network and vice versa to provide transparent routing between the two IP domains without requiring any changes to end points. NA(P)T-PT provides additional translation of transport identifier (TCP and UDP port numbers). The approach is similar to that one described also in 3GPP TS 29.162 [8].Further details are described in 3GPP TS 23.228 [4].          </td>

The IBCF acting as exit point applies the procedures described in clause 5.10.2 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] before forwarding the SIP signalling to the IBCF acting as entry point. The IBCF acting as entry point applies the procedures described in clause 5.10.3 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].Additionally, in case there is no trust relationship between the two IM CN subsystems connected by II-NNI, the IBCF applies the procedures described in clause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], before forwarding the SIP signalling.These procedures may be utilized on a per header field basis to realize overall trust as well as per service level screening of header fields. Trust relationships and trust domains may be defined by inter-operator agreements for individual services and/or individual SIP header fields.The management of the SIP header fields (if present) over II-NNI in case of a presence or not of a trust relationship between the two interconnected IM CN subsystems is wrapped up in the following table.Table 6.2: Management of SIP header fields and parameters over II-NNI in presence or not of a trust relationshipItem	Header field or parameter	Reference	Trust relationship	Not trust relationship1	P-Asserted-Identity	IETF RFC 3325 [44]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.42	P-Access-Network-Info	IETF RFC 7315 [24]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.43	Resource-Priority	IETF RFC 4412 [78]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.44	History-Info	IETF RFC 7044 [25]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in clause 7 of IETF RFC 7044 [25] and in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.45	P-Asserted-Service	IETF RFC 6050 [26]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4(NOTE 3)	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4 (NOTE 3)6	P-Charging-Vector	IETF RFC 7315 [24]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 5.10	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 5.107	P-Charging-Function-Addresses(NOTE 4)	IETF RFC 7315 [24]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 5.10	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 5.108	P-Profile-Key(NOTE 2)	IETF RFC 5002 [64]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.49	P-Private-Network-Indication	IETF RFC 7316 [84]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.410	P-Served-User(NOTE 1, NOTE 2)	IETF RFC 5502 [85]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.411	Reason (in a response)	IETF RFC 6432 [49]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.412	P-Early-Media	IETF RFC 5009 [74]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.413	Feature-Caps	IETF RFC 6809 [143]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.414	Priority(NOTE 6)	IETF RFC 7090 [184]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.415	"iotl" SIP URI parameter(NOTE 7)	IETF RFC 7549 [188]	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.416	"cpc" tel URI parameter(NOTE 5)	TS 24.229 [5] clause 7.2A.12	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.417	"oli" tel URI parameter(NOTE 5)	TS 24.229 [5] clause 7.2A.12	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.418	Restoration-Info(NOTE 2)	TS 24.229 [5] clause 7.2.11	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.419	Relayed-Charge(NOTE 4)	TS 24.229 [5] clause 7.2.12	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4	As specified in TS 24.229 [5], clause 4.4NOTE 1:	For a roaming II-NNI, a trust relationship with respect to this header field is required.NOTE 2:	This header field is only applicable on a roaming II-NNI.NOTE 3:	In addition, value-dependent operator policies may be applied.NOTE 4:	This header field is not applicable at II-NNI.NOTE 5:	The tel URI parameters "cpc" and "oli" can be included in the URI in the P-Asserted-Identity header field.NOTE 6:	Only the "psap-callback" value is part of the trust domain.NOTE 7:	The "iotl" SIP URI parameter can be transported in the Request-URI, Route header field, Path header field, Service-Route header field, "+g.3gpp.trf" header field parameter, "+g.3gpp.atcf-mgmt-uri" header field parameter and in the "ATU-STI" parameter in the "application/vnd.3gpp.srvcc-info+xml" MIME body.          </td>

For "end-to-end" media session involving the II-NNI, the SIP/<strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> codec negotiation procedure can be applied between IM CN subsystems using different media codecs. It is possible that the end-to-end codec negotiation could fail because no common codec could be supported by the UEs, in particular for voice services.To enhance interoperability, the IBCF, the MRFC, or other IMS network entities can interfere with the end-to-end codec negotiation to offer additional codec(s) available via transcoding, or to remove codecs. The IBCF can configure an attached <strong><font color=red>TrGW</font></strong> to transcode, and the MRFC can configure an attached MRFP to transcode.Codecs applicable at the II-NNI may be a subject of interworking agreements.NOTE 1:	Possible codecs which could be used at the II-NNI are described in 3GPP TS 26.114 [11] and ETSI 3GPP TS 181 005 [12].NOTE 2:	As described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], the IETF RFC 4733 [157] is used to encode <strong><font color=red>DTMF</font></strong> events and a <strong><font color=red>payload</font></strong> type number associated with the MIME subtype "telephone-event" is included in a <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> message.However, to avoid that transcoding is performed several times, applicable codecs at the II-NNI should be restricted as little as possible in the inter-operator agreements. It is not recommended to set only codecs which are not agreed to use by the inter-operator agreement into the <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> of the SIP message at the II-NNI. Whether it is allowed to offer codecs which are not included in the applicable codec list made by inter-operator agreements over the II-NNI is also determined by the inter-operator agreement if necessary.NOTE 3:	Transcoding can be performed in an IMS network serving an <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> offerer or in an IMS network serving an <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> answerer. To avoid that transcoding is performed multiple times, inter-operator agreements can clarify if it is preferred that IMS network serving an <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> offerer or IMS network serving an <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> answerer modify an <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> offer to offer transcoding.If the IBCF performs media transcoding control, the IBCF shall apply the related procedures in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].          </td>

The following URI formats in SIP messages may be applied at the Ici as standardized in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]:;	SIP URI defined in IETF RFC 3261 [13];;	tel URI defined in IETF RFC 3966 [14];;	IM URI defined in IETF RFC 3860 [15]; and;	PRES URI defined in IETF  RFC 3859 [16].According to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], the IBCF acting as an exit or entry point in the IMS network supports these URI formats. These URI formats shall be supported at the roaming II-NNI. The SIP URI format shall be supported at the non-roaming II-NNI. For the loopback traversal scenario both the SIP URI and the tel URI shall be supported. The tel URI, IM URI and PRES URI formats may be supported at the non-roaming II-NNI based on agreement between operators. For the loopback traversal scenario the IM URI and PRES URI may be supported based on agreement between operators. Other URI formats may be supported over the II-NNI depending on the operator agreements.A global number as defined in IETF RFC 3966 [14] shall be used in a tel URI or in the user portion of a SIP URI with the user=phone parameter when conveyed via a non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario in the Request-URI and in the P-Asserted-Identity header field, except when agreement exists between the operators to also allow other kinds of numbers.NOTE 1:	In a SIP URI the user portion of the Request-URI represents a telephone number only if the SIP URI includes the user=phone parameter.NOTE 2:	Agreements can exist between operators to allow non-global number (e.g. national service numbers. business trunking numbers, or private numbers) at a non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario. A SIP URI with such a number, a user=phone parameter, and a phone-context parameter agreed between the operators can then be used.NOTE 3:	3GPP TS 24.229 [5] allows to restrict the number within a SIP Request-URI with user=phone parameter at a non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario to be a global number (i.e. E.164 in international format) via an appropriate Application Server. Suitable configuration by the operator is needed to achieve the desired modification of the format.NOTE 4:	The allowed phone number formats in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of a served user are configured by the operator. According to 3GPP TS 23.003 [35], international E.164 format is used within a P-Asserted-Identity header field.NOTE 5:	The global number format usage within a SIP Request-URI with the user=phone parameter at a non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario allows the terminating network to find the called subscriber, via HSS interrogation, without any further number translation and thus improves the success of the interconnection between IMS operators.The optional "oli" and "cpc" tel URI parameters associated with a tel URI or a SIP URI with user=phone are described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] clause 7.2A.12 and can be part of the P-Asserted-Identity header field. Depending on operator agreements, those URI parameters may be supported at the non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario.The "sos" SIP URI parameter associated with a URI in the Contact header field of a REGISTER request or a 200 (OK) response to REGISTER request is described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]. The "sos" SIP URI parameter shall be supported at the roaming II-NNI.The "sos" SIP URI parameter associated with the Request-URI for all dialogs and standalone SIP requests described in clause 5.2.10.3 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and shall be supported at the roaming II-NNI.The "rn" and "npdi" number portability parameters for the tel URI and the SIP URI with user=phone as described within IETF RFC 4694 [75] can be part of the Request-URI. Depending on operator agreements these parameters may be exchanged over the non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario.NOTE 6:	The "rn" and "npdi" parameters can be used to address the entry point of the terminating operator depending on national rules for number portability.The "isub" tel URI parameter for the tel URI and the SIP URI with user=phone as described within IETF RFC 3966 [14] can be part of the Request-URI, To header field and P-Asserted-Identity header field. Depending on operator agreements, this URI parameter may be exchanged over the II-NNI.The "premium-rate" tel URI parameter for the tel URI and the SIP URI with user=phone as described within 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] clause 7.2A.17 can be part of the Request-URI. Depending on operator agreements, this URI parameter may be exchanged at the roaming II-NNI.          </td>

In order to assure the end-to-end service interoperability through the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI), the associated supplementary services of the multimedia telephony communication service may be supported on the II-NNI between the two IMS networks.The MMTEL communication service is identified by means of the "urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel" URN. The "urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel" can appear in:-	the media feature tag "g.3gpp.icsi-ref" (specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] clause 7.2A.8) in the Contact header field and the Accept-Contact header field;-	the feature-capability indicator "g.3gpp.icsi-ref" (specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] clause 7.9A.2) in the Feature-Caps header field; and-	the P-Asserted-Service header field.The support of each associated supplementary service is based on agreement between operators.If a supplementary service is supported, the related procedures from the 3GPP TS 22.173 [30], the protocol details from the 3GPP TS 24.173 [31] and specifications referenced in the 3GPP TS 24.173 [31] shall be applied with the requirements in the relevant clause below due to the crossing of the II-NNI.A classification of the importance of supplementary services applicable over the II-NNI is available in the informative annex Db of 3GPP TS 22.173 [30].NOTE:	Agreeing on interworking of entire class of services according to this classification can simplify the cooperation between interconnecting networks but remains optional.          </td>

          <td>
This annex provides the applicability of SIP header fields in SIP messages over II-NNI by using the methodology of a so-called "dynamic view", as used in IETF RFC 3261 [13] and other SIP related RFCs. This methodology documents the presence of SIP header fields in SIP messages over the II-NNI and also takes into account dynamic conditions, for instance the presence of a SIP header field in a SIP request message as condition for the SIP header field in the corresponding SIP response message.Specific information about the applicability of SIP header fields in SIP messages in a dynamic view is also provided for cases where an MMTEL supplementary service is supported over the II-NNI between operators.The applicability of SIP header fields described in this annex is based on the procedures described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and the list of SIP header fields in annex A of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].          </td>

The meaning of the notation codes used in the tables in subsequent clauses is as follows:In the "RFC status" column, the notation codes defined in IETF RFC 3261 [13] clause 20 are applied.In the "II-NNI condition" column the notation codes defined in table B.2.1 are used. If a capability of a SIP header field is specified as either optional or conditional in table 6.1.3.1, then "II-NNI condition" of the SIP header field is described with conditional expression.In each request-related table, the order of SIP header fields inherits that of clause A.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].In each response-related table, the SIP status code for which the header field is applicable is described in the "SIP status code" column. The notation codes for the "where" column as defined in IETF RFC 3261 [13] clause 20 are applied. The notation code "r" in "SIP status code" column corresponds to any SIP status code which is described in annex A of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] for the corresponding method. Any SIP header field not listed in a table is not applicable for the corresponding SIP message.Table B.2.1: Key to notation codes for SIP header fields in dynamic view for II-NNINotation code(NOTE 1)	Meaningdc	The SIP header field is required to be present in a SIP message over II-NNI according to the procedures specified in other specifications e.g. TS 24.229 [5].dm	The SIP header field shall be always present in a SIP message over II-NNI, and if received, it must be handled according to TS 24.229 [5].dm*	The SIP header field should be present in a SIP message over II-NNI, but the IMS network need to be prepared to receive a SIP message without that header field.do	The SIP header field can be present in a SIP message over II-NNI, and if received, it must be handled according to TS 24.229 [5]. (NOTE 2)dt	The header field should be present in a SIP message over II-NNI, but the IMS network need to be prepared to receive a SIP message without that header field.If TCP is used as a transport, then the header field must be present in a SIP message.d*	The SIP header field is required to be present in a SIP message if the message body is not empty.dn/a	The SIP header field is shall not be present in a SIP message over II-NNI. (NOTE 3)dc<integer>	The condition for the presence of the SIP header field. <integer> is the identifier of the condition. This notation code is applied only in each request-related or response-related table.NOTE 1:	The meaning of the notation codes is same as in IETF RFC 3261 [13] clause 20 and "d" is used to emphasise the dynamic view.NOTE 2:	If specified by local policy rules, the IBCF acting as entry point may omit or modify any received SIP header fields prior to forwarding SIP messages as specified in TS 24.229 [5] clause 5.10.6.2.NOTE 3:	The SIP header field can be removed at the IBCF acting as exit point by using screening functionality defined in TS 24.229 [5] clause 5.10.6.2.          </td>

This annex provides a list of items that are recommended to be selected by inter-operator agreements for the interconnection between IMS operators using the II-NNI. The items in this annex have an influence on the service interconnection.For the purposes of this annex, these items are called "option items". The option items are extracted from the present document other than this annex, and are categorized from the aspect of service provisioning by IMS operators.If an option item is used based on inter-operator agreements, then relating capabilities described in the references are used over the II-NNI. In case of misalignment between the normative part of the present document and this annex, the normative part of the present document takes precedence.          </td>
