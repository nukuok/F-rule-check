Contents This Standard specifies national supplementary specifications of [TS 29.165] within the scope described in Subclause 1.1. This Standard distinguishes the specifications of the non-roaming II-NNI from those of the roaming II-NNI, as is the case with [TS 29.165]. Note that the term "II-NNI" is used in this Standard if a specification is common to the non-roaming II-NNI and roaming II-NNI. NOTE 1: Note that the descriptions regarding the II-NNI in this document are not applied for the roaming II-NNI in the present version of this Standard. NOTE 2: [TS 29.165] referenced in this Standard does not distinguish mobile networks from fixed networks.              </td>

Based on the inter-operator agreements, a SIP URI containing a non-global number may be set into the Request-URI of a SIP request outside an existing dialog, as described in Subclause 8.1 of [TS 29.165]. {Appendix Table i.4.17 Item 1} When requesting routing of a SIP request outside an existing dialog based on a global E.164 number of the telephone-subscriber part, visual-separators shall not be used for the description of the global-number. The formats of the called party number are listed in Table 4.1.1.2.1.

When an originating IMS network accesses ENUM/DNS specified in [JJ-90.31], the originating IMS network shall set "npdi" tel URI parameter to indicate to a terminating IMS network that the originating IMS network has already accessed to ENUM/DNS. When the NAPTR resource record being used for updating the Request-URI includes "rn" parameter containing a network routing number, the retrieved "rn" parameter containing the network routing number shall be set into the Request-URI of a SIP request outside an existing dialog. NOTE: In the period that there are both interconnection on ISUP interface defined in [JJ-90.10] and interconnection on SIP interface defined in this Standard, a NAPTR resource record containing "rn" parameter may be returned from ENUM/DNS interface defined in [JJ-90.31]. When receiving a SIP request outside an existing dialog containing "npdi" parameter, a terminating IMS network shall consider that ENUM/DNS access has been done in the preceding IMS network, and then should not access ENUM/DNS defined in [JJ-90.31]. The terminating IMS network should continue routing process even if telephone-subscriber part contains other unrecognizded tel URI parameter(s). When an originating IMS network requests the routing based on the called party number in a SIP request outside an existing dialog, the valid number of received digits (in the range between the minimum number of received digits and the maximum number of received digits) for the non-global number of the valid Request-URI may be configured. If the number of received digits as a non-global number is less than the configured minimum number of digits or more than configured maximum number of digits, then the originating IMS network sends an appropriate SIP response and performs a call release procedure. The minimum and maximum number of digits shall be determined in the inter-operator agreements. {Appendix Table i.4.17 Item 3}            </td>

Calling party number presentation and restriction Calling party number presentation and restriction is realized by means of delivering network asserted user identity information and presentation/restriction information. If the network asserted user identity information is delivered between the IMS networks, then a trust relationship with respect to the P-Asserted-Identity header field shall exist between the two interconnected networks. The terms used in this subclause, "network asserted user identity information" and "presentation/restriction information" are defined as follows: (Network asserted user identity information) This is information with respect to an identity of a user that is asserted by the network through authentication or other means (or verified by the network when an identity is provided by the user) in a trusted network. An example of network asserted user identity information is an E.164 number reachable to the user. Note that subaddress information provided by the originating user can be included. (Presentation/restriction information) This is information specifying whether a user is allowing or prohibiting the presentation of its network asserted user identity information to another user receiving a SIP message. (1) The calling party number is delivered in a SIP request outside an existing dialog (INVITE, MESSAGE, SUBSCRIBE or REFER request outside an existing dialog). (2) The calling party number is set in each parameter value of the P-Asserted-Identity header field. This header field shall be set in a SIP request outside an existing dialog in accordance with [TS 29.165]. (3) For elements associated with the handling of the calling party number, the parameters defined in Table 4.2.1 are used and the presentation conditions conform to Table 4.2.2. Table 4.2.1 / JJ-90.30: Elements associated with handling of calling party number 1) SIP_URI Network asserted user identity reachable from the IMS network. The addr-spec part of the SIP URI in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of a SIP request outside an existing dialog is symbolized by the "SIP_URI". 2) SIP_DISPLAYNAME Network asserted user identity associated with the SIP_URI, including information other than the number to be displayed to the terminating user. The display-name part of the SIP_URI in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of a SIP request outside an existing dialog, which is character strings in UTF-8 <strong><font color=red>encoding</font></strong>, is symbolized by the "SIP_DISPLAYNAME". When it is enclosed in quotation marks, the "SIP_DISPLAYNAME" is character strings left after removing the double quotation marks (DQUOTE). Omission of the SIP_DISPLAYNAME indicates that a display format different from the SIP_URI is not particularly desired. In this case, the IMS network should take into account that the character strings of the SIP_URI are used for display, unless special restrictions are specified. 3) TEL_URI Network asserted user identity consisting of an E.164 number reachable from a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The global-number-digits in the telephone-subscriber part of the tel URI in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of a SIP request outside an existing dialog is symbolized by the "TEL_URI". Omission of the TEL_URI indicates that the originating user has no E.164 number for receiving incoming calls. 4) TEL_DISPLAYNAME Network asserted user identity consisting of a dial number by which the originating user can be reached based on a numbering plan. The display-name part of the tel URI in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of a SIP request outside an existing dialog is symbolized by the "TEL_DISPLAYNAME". When it is enclosed in quotation marks, the "TEL_DISPLAYNAME" is the character strings left after removing the double quotation marks (DQUOTE). Omission of the TEL_DISPLAYNAME indicates that a dial number different from the number indicated by the TEL_URI is not particularly desired, or that the network does not have accurate information pertaining to the dialling numbering plan that can be used by the terminating user. In this case, the IMS network should take into account that the character strings of the TEL_URI are equivalent to the TEL_DISPLAYNAME, unless special restrictions are specified. 5) PRIVACY Presentation/restriction information identifying whether the presentation of network asserted user identity to the terminating user is allowed. The value (priv-value) of the Privacy header field of a SIP request outside an existing dialog is symbolized by the "PRIVACY".  Table 4.2.2 / JJ-90.30: Conditions for presentation of calling party number Component Mapping condition Notes Calling party number (Subscriber number) TEL_URI Used as a number identifying the originating user. Visual-separators are not used. Specific setting contents are listed in Table 4.2.3. Generic number (Notified number) TEL_DISPLAYNAME Used when a number other than the calling party number is notified to the terminating side. Visual-separators are not used. Specific setting contents are listed in Table 4.2.4. Presentation/restriction PRIVACY "none" and "id" are treated as displayable and not displayable, respectively. Values other than "none" and "id" shall not be set. Assumed to be displayable when the Privacy header field is absent. When both calling party number (subscriber number) and generic number (notified number) are set, this component is treated as the presentation/restriction for the generic number (notified number), and the calling number (subscriber number) is uniformly handled as the number being restricted to display. Cause of no ID SIP_DISPLAYNAME Character strings in UTF-8 <strong><font color=red>encoding</font></strong>. When the presentation/restriction information is restriction, the character strings in Table 4.2.5 can be used to indicate the cause. If the "SIP_DISPLAYNAME" is not set, or if character strings not listed in Table 4.2.5 are set, then the call is handled as if "Unavailable" were specified.

Guidance/talkie services provided by terminating IMS network It is conceivable that guidance/talkie services might be provided from the terminating IMS network within either an early dialog or a confirmed dialog. Guidance/talkie services provided from the terminating IMS network within an early dialog are realized by adding <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> information into a 18x provisional response. From the view point of preventing illegally non-charged calls on an early dialog, the terminating IMS network can return a 18x provisional response with <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> information only when the terminating IMS network can manage and guarantee the contents of audio <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong>. The terminating IMS network shall not forward a 18x provisional response transparently if the 18x provisional response contains <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> information inserted by terminating user equipment. Guidance/talkie services provided within a confirmed dialog from the terminating IMS network are handled as normally connected calls (successful calls) at the originating IMS network.            </td>

The status codes used for guidance/talkie services are determined in the inter-operator agreements. {Appendix Table i.4.19 Item 1}            </td>

Connections to network-originated <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> audio during call establishment In a PSTN, a terminating network and a transit network can connect to an announcement service for an unsuccessful call in order to provide the originating user with a voice message to notify why the call was unsuccessful. The voice path from the terminating side to the originating side is normally connected before call establishment in a PSTN; therefore, the audio inserted by the network can be heard by the originating user even before the call is completed. In the circumstances in which a terminating user equipment is not completely-controlled by the network, the equipment can send out <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> audio over the II-NNI. For preventing illegal use of the network, an originating IMS network or a transit IMS network may prohibit any path connections before call establishment. In this case, operators need to prepare some kind of mechanism whereby paths can still be connected before call establishment to establish announcement connections through the II-NNI. This subclause describes the requirements for IMS networks to enable the network-originated <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> audio to be connected to the originating IMS network via an II-NNI before call establishment.            </td>

Provisional response Annex Figure c.3.1.1 / JJ-90.30: Connection model of IMS networks related to network-originated <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> audio  The classes of IMS networks that play a role in network-originated <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> audio connections in the above model are described below. Note that these are logical classes whose roles may change depending on the call being originated. Also note that an IMS network is capable of undertaking multiple roles simultaneously, the roles themselves may be omitted if not required, in calls that are actually established. (IMS network connecting to network-originated <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong>) This is an IMS network that connects to a network-managed <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> audio source before call establishment with regard to an initial INVITE request received via an II-NNI. The IMS network is responsible for the content of the audio source connected before call establishment. This network corresponds to an IMS network that actually prepares network-originated announcements, such as congestion talkies, then performs connections according to conditions. (IMS network relaying provisional responses) This is an IMS network that transmits a corresponding initial INVITE request received from the originating IMS network via an II-NNI to the terminating network via an II-NNI. (IMS network managing path connections before call establishment) This is an IMS network that manages path connections to prevent the connection of the audio path from the terminating side to the originating side before call establishment corresponding to the call being established by the initial INVITE request sent via an II-NNI. An IMS network managing the path connections before call establishment shall manage the equipment that terminates <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> voice traffic from the terminating IMS network. Equipment that can be used to manage these path connections includes MGW that connects with PSTN, and SBC that terminates <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> packets in a network.            </td>

Procedures at the originating IMS network for network-originated <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> audio during call establishment The following supplementary specification is applied to the 180 (Ringing) and 183 (Session Progress) responses: - An IMS network that sends a SIP response may send <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> information only when the IMS network can manage and guarantee the contents of the <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> audio sent out to another IMS network that receives the SIP response. Accordingly, when an IMS network that has received an initial INVITE request via an II-NNI connects a network-originated <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> audio before call establishment, the IMS network shall insert an <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> into either a 180 (Ringing) or 183 (Session Progress) response for <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> connection only when the IMS network can manage and guarantee the contents of the <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> audio sent out to another IMS network that receives the SIP response. Also, when there is a possibility of receiving an <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> from an entity that is unable to guarantee the contents of a connected <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> due to the circumstances of the network configuration or user equipment management1, one of the following procedures shall be performed against the SIP message received from such an entity2. 1 This condition includes cases in which it is possible for a subscriber who is performing unexpected actions (possibly with malicious intent) to send outside the framework normally envisaged by the IMS network. 2 When it is guaranteed that there is no IMS network managing path connections before call establishment on the originating IMS network side (i.e. the receiving side of the SIP response), there is no specific problem as the illegal use of network even if the countermeasures mentioned here are not taken. However, countermeasures should be taken from the viewpoint of ensuring normality and expandability of connections on the II-NNI. 3 In this case, it may be necessary for the IMS network to have a function that terminates an <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> such as an SBC. 1. Delete the <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> and send the corresponding SIP response. 2. Send the SIP response including received <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong>, but prevent delivering the <strong><font color=red>RTP</font></strong> from the terminating side to the originating side. When adopting Procedure 1, an <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> may not be included in the 200 (OK) response that might subsequently be sent in which the "100rel" extension is applied. Therefore, if an IMS network deletes the contents of the <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> from the provisional response, then the IMS network shall store the received <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> before deleting the <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong>. If there is no <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> included in the 200 (OK) response, then the IMS network shall insert the stored <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> into the 200 (OK) response as if the <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> is received in the 200 (OK) response. When adopting Procedure 2, it shall be ensured that the terminating side is not made aware of the address and port information included in the <strong><font color=red>SDP</font></strong> of the received initial INVITE request3.          </td>

General When a service in which a logical number is used as a called party number (e.g. the number for toll free services beginning with "0120" or "0800", the number for unified service beginning with "0570") is invoked, the logical number is translated into an actual number used for routing of a call to the terminating user equipment (e.g. the number "0AB-J", the number beginning with "0A0"). In a network serving the terminating user equipment, the supplementary services (e.g. notification of an original called logical number to the terminating user equipment, call rejection when an original called number is an actual number mapped from a service number) can be provided. Therefore, the history information of number translation from a logical number to an actual number needs to be delivered through the II-NNI. This annex provides the procedures for delivering the history information of number translation over the II-NNI. Application of delivering the history information of number translation at the II-NNI is determined in the inter-operator agreements in accordance with Clause 22 of [TS 29.165]. {Appendix Table i.4.13 Item 4}            </td>

Introduction For improving the inter-connectivity between IMS networks within Japan, this appendix provides the list of option items that are recommended to be selected by inter-operator agreements in this Standard. If there remains item(s) that should be determined for an option item by the inter-operator agreements in "Details for operator choice" in Annex a of this Standard, then the option item is also listed here, even if "Applicability at the II-NNI" of the option item is already selected. Note that any interaction among the option items is not described in the list of option items, as with [TS 29.165]. Note also that if there are misalignments between [TS 29.165] and this appendix, or misalignments between the normative part of this Standard and this appendix, [TS 29.165] and the normative part of this Standard take precedence.            </td>

No hatching This type of item is option item.  In case "Yes" is selected in the inter-operator agreements. This means the capability(ies) and/or service(s) relating to the option item are provided over the II-NNI. In this case, each side IMS operator's network of II-NNI support the capability(ies) in accordance with this Standard and normative reference(s). In case "No" is selected in the inter-operator agreements. This means the capability(ies) and/or service(s) relating to the option item are not provided over the II-NNI. In this case, each side IMS operator's network of II-NNI will not gurantee the provision of the capability(ies) in accordance with this Standard and normative reference(s). 5 Details for operator choice This column shows the details for the inter-operator agreements if the corresponding pattern is chosen in the "Applicability at the II-NNI". The clarifications in this Standard are described between angled brackets (( )). This column intends to be used to exchange each detailed conditions of the II-NNI by means of filling the conditions in the columns corresponding to the selected pattern. Blank row intends to be used as a place holder for describing additional detailed conditions specific to the operator network not associated with the explicit descriptions in this appendix.            </td>

Presentation/restriction information If both the valid parameters of the generic number (see Subclause ii.2.4.2) and the valid parameters of the calling party number (see Subclause ii.2.4.2) are present in the ISUP initial address message (IAM), then the address presentation restriction indicator of the generic number is interworked as follows: - If the received address presentation restriction indicator contains "presentation allowed", then the presentation/restriction information is "presentation". - If the received address presentation restriction indicator contains the value other than "presentation allowed", then the presentation/restriction information is "restriction". NOTE: The case in which the valid generic number parameters are present but the valid calling party number parameters are not does not normally occur. In this case, the setting of the presentation/restriction information is based on operator policy. If the valid parameters of the generic number are not present but the valid parameters of the calling party number are in the ISUP initial address message (IAM), then the address presentation restriction indicator of the calling party number is interworked as follows: - If the received address presentation restriction indicator contains "presentation allowed", then the presentation/restriction information is "presentation". - If the received address presentation restriction indicator contains the value other than "presentation allowed", then the presentation/restriction information is "restriction". If neither the valid parameters of the generic number nor the valid parameters of the calling party number are present, the presentation/restriction information is "restriction".          </td>

ISUP to SIP In the redirection mechanism used between PSTNs, the IAM redirected and redirection REL are used to transfer the following address information: - Network routing number - Called directory number NOTE: The network routing number can be included in the address signal of the called party number parameter in the IAM or included in the address signal of the redirection number parameter in the REL. NOTE: Called directory number is included in the address signal of the called directory number parameter. When a MGCF receives an IAM that was redirected, the global-number-digits of the Request-URI in the initial INVITE request is derived from the called directory number. Then the "npdi" tel URI parameter and the "rn" parameter containing the network routing number that starts from "81" are populated. When a MGCF receives a REL that triggers the redirection, the global-number-digits of the SIP URI in the Contact header field of 3xx response is derived from the called directory number.

Basic principle If the maximum number of simultaneous SIP sessions is determined in the inter-operator agreements, then the operators can restrict the number of outgoing simultaneous SIP sessions (called unidirectional session management) when some kind of event (e.g., network congestion) occurs in order to prevent the network resources for the control plane from being occupied by unidirectional session establishment attempts from one side of the interconnected network. {Appendix Table i.4.22 Item 1} The number of simultaneous SIP sessions is incremented when a SIP request outside an existing dialog (e.g., initial INVITE request) is sent out, and decremented when a SIP session is terminated. When the number of simultaneous SIP sessions is controlled by conditions other than the maximum number of SIP sessions, the detailed condition is determined in the inter-operator agreements.            </td>

1.3. Controlling number of outgoing SIP sessions by unidirectional session management The maximum number of outgoing SIP sessions at each side of an operator's network is determined in the inter-operator agreements. The sum of both side of the operator's maximum numbers of outgoing SIP sessions is equal to the maximum number of SIP sessions. If the control of the reserved number of SIP sessions for calling subscribers with priority is required in addition to the control of the number of outgoing SIP sessions, each IMS network configures the number of reserved SIP sessions based on the operator policy and applies the control of the reserved SIP sessions. In this case, the number of the reserved SIP sessions is included in the maximum number of outgoing SIP sessions.            </td>

(1) Pre-blocking function  The pre-blocking function restricts the sending out of a SIP request outside an existing dialog from its own network to the opposite network based on the IP addresses belonging to the opposite network. Established sessions are not restricted. The operator responsible for maintenance can confirm or be notified that all sessions are terminated. (2) Blocking function  The blocking function restricts the sending out of a SIP request outside an existing dialog from its own network to the opposite network, but does not restrict the receiving of a SIP request outside an existing dialog from the opposite network to its own network.  When implementing a function that sends a test call in the network, the network can send a test call to the opposite network, even if blocking is being enforced in the network.              </td>

Introduction [RFC 3261] specifies that a SIP message shall be transported using TCP transport when sending a SIP message whose total length exceeds the length that may cause fragmentation on UDP transport. This appendix describes the transport mechanism when TCP transport is used over the II-NNI, as an example usage of TCP transport. In particular, this appendix provides the details not clarified in [RFC 3261].            </td>

TCP transport mechanism According to the specification of [RFC 3261], the principle of usage are: - A SIP request is sent on the TCP connection established from the node sending the SIP request. - A SIP response to the SIP request is sent on the TCP connection on which the SIP request was received. Therefore, two TCP connections, a TCP connection established by one side of the II-NNI and a TCP connection established by the other side of the II-NNI, are normally established between the two nodes for sending and receiving SIP message over the II-NNI. There is a concern about the performance impact on the IMS network where massive calls are handled due to per-call basis establishment and release of TCP connection specified in [RFC 3261]. Therefore, the existing TCP connections over the II-NNI can be retained for a long period and be used for the transportation of multiple SIP messages. When the TCP connection established by its own node is temporarily unable to be used for sending SIP requests while two TCP connections are retained for a long period, another TCP connection established by the node on the opposite side of the II-NNI can be used for sending SIP requests outside an existing dialog, based on the inter-operator agreements. {Appendix Table i.4.9 Item 3} Other conditions on the usage of TCP transport (e.g. port number, timer condition, maximum SIP message length) are determined based on the inter-operator agreements. {Appendix Table i.4.9 Item 3}            </td>

Long-period TCP connection establishment and release trigger If the long-period TCP connections are used over the II-NNI, the TCP connections can be established prior to sending and receiving SIP messages over the II-NNI. In this case, the procedure of TCP connection establishment and release, and the number of simultaneous TCP connections are determined based on the inter-operator agreements. {Appendix Table i.4.9 Item 1} For the purpose of alive monitoring, the keepalive mechanism is recommended to apply for existing long-term TCP connections over the II-NNI. If keepalive mechanism is used, the timeout value is assumed to be small enough compared to SIP Timer B, and the basic procedure consists of sending probe packets from both sides. Parameters of the keepalive procedure are determined based on the inter-operator agreements. {Appendix Table i.4.9 Item 2}              </td>
